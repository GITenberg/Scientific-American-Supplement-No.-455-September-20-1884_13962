<h2>THE GIRAFFE.</h2>

<p>The spirited view herewith presented, representing the "Fall of
the Giraffe" before the rifle of a sportsman, we take from the
<i>Illustrated London News</i>. Hunting the giraffe has long been a
favorite sport among the more adventurous of British sportsmen, its
natural range being all the wooded parts of eastern, central, and
southern Africa, though of late years it has been greatly thinned
out before the settlements advancing from the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>

<p class="ctr">THE FALL OF THE GIRAFFE.</p>

<p>The characteristics of this singular animal are in some
particulars those of the camel, the ox, and the antelope. Its eyes
are beautiful, extremely large, and so placed that the animal can
see much of what is passing on all sides, and even behind it, so
that it is approached with the greatest difficulty. The animal when
full grown attains sometimes a height of fifteen to seventeen feet.
It feeds on the leaves and twigs of trees principally, its immense
length of legs and height at the withers rendering it difficult for
the animal to graze on an even surface. It is not easily overtaken
except by a swift horse, but when surprised or run down it can
defend itself with considerable vigor by kicking, thus, it is said,
often tiring out and beating off the lion. It was formerly almost
universally believed that the fore legs were longer than the hinder
ones, but in fact the hind legs are the longer by about one inch,
the error having been caused by the great development and height of
the withers, to give a proper base to the long neck and towering
head. The color varies a good deal, the head being generally a
reddish brown, and the neck, back, and sides marked with
tessellated, rust colored spots with narrow white divisions. Many
specimens have been brought to this country, the animal being
extremely docile in confinement, feeding from the hand, and being
very friendly to those who are kind to it.</p>

<p>An experiment has been made in Vienna which proves that even
with incandescent lights special precautions must be taken to avoid
any risk of fire. A lamp having been enveloped with paper and
lighted by a current, the heat generated was sufficient to set fire
to the paper, which burnt out and caused the lamp to explode.</p>

<h2>THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH AS SHOWN BY DEEP MINES.</h2>

<p>At a recent meeting of the American Society of Civil Engineers,
observations on the temperature of the earth, as shown by deep
mines, were presented by Messrs. Hamilton Smith, Jr., and Edward B
Dorsey. Mr. Smith said that the temperature of the earth varies
very greatly at different localities and in different geological
formations. There are decided exceptions to the general law that
the temperature increased with the depth. At the New Almaden
quicksilver mine, in California, at a depth of about 600 feet the
temperature was very high&mdash;some 115 degrees; but in the
deepest part of the same mine, 1,800 feet below the surface and 500
feet below sea level, the temperature is very pleasant, probably
less than 80 degrees. At the Eureka mines, in California, the air
1,200 feet below the surface appears nearly as cool as 100 feet
below the surface. The normal temperature of the earth at a depth
of 50 or 60 feet is probably near the mean annual temperature of
the air at the particular place. At the Comstock mines, some years
since, the miners could remain but a few moments at a time, on
account of the heat. Ice water was given them as an experiment; it
produced no ill effects, but the men worked to much better
advantage; and since that time, ice water is furnished in all these
mines, and drunk with apparently no bad results.</p>

<p>Mr. E.B. Dorsey said that the mines on the Comstock vein,
Nevada, were exceptionally hot. At depths of from 1,500 to 2,000
feet, the thermometer placed in a freshly drilled hole will show
130 degrees. Very large bodies of water have run for years at 155
degrees, and smaller bodies at 170 degrees. The temperature of the
air is kept down to 110 degrees by forcing in fresh air cooled over
ice.</p>

<p>Captain Wheeler, U.S. Engineers, estimated the heat extracted
annually from the Comstock by means of the water pumped out and
cold air forced in, as equal to that generated by the combustion of
55,560 tons of anthracite coal or 97,700 cords of wood.
Observations were then given upon temperature at every 100 feet in
the Forman shaft of the Overman mine, running from 53 degrees at a
depth of 100 feet to 121.2 degrees at a depth of 2,300 feet. The
temperature increased:</p>

<ul>
<li>100 to 1,000 feet deep, increase 1 degree in 29 feet.</li>

<li>100 to 1,800 feet deep, increase 1 degree in 30.5 feet.</li>

<li>100 to 2,300 feet deep, increase 1 degree in 32.3 feet.</li>
</ul>

<p>A table was presented giving the temperatures of a large number
of deep mines, tunnels, and artesian wells. The two coolest mines
or tunnels are in limestone, namely, Chanarcillo mines and Mont
Cenis tunnel; and the two hottest are in trachyte and the "coal
measures," namely, the Comstock mines in trachyte and the South
Balgray in the "coal measures." Mr. Dorsey considered that
experience showed that limestone was the coolest formation.</p>

<h2>GALLISIN, AN UNFERMENTABLE SUBSTANCE IN STARCH SUGAR.</h2>

<p>C. Schmitt and A. Coblenzl have made a careful investigation of
the unfermentable substances found in commercial starch sugars, and
have succeeded in isolating a definite compound, to which they give
the name gallisin. The method of separation and purification which
they made use of is as follows: 5 kilogrammes of commercial starch
sugar were allowed to ferment. At a temperature of 18-20&deg; C.
and with a solution containing 20 per cent. the fermentation was
complete in five to six days. It was filtered; the perfectly clear,
almost colorless, liquid evaporated as far as possible on the
water-bath, and the sirup while still warm brought into a
good-sized flask. The sirup was then well shaken with a large
excess of absolute alcohol, when it became viscous, but did not mix
with the alcohol. The latter was poured off, replaced by fresh
alcohol, and again shaken. When this shaking with alcohol has been
repeated several times, the sirup is finally changed to a
yellowish-gray mass. This is now brought into a large mortar, and
rubbed up under a mixture of alcohol and ether. After some time the
whole mass is transformed into a gray powder. It is quickly
filtered off with the aid of an aspirator, washed with alcohol and
then with ether, and brought under a desiccator with concentrated
sulphuric acid. In order to purify the substance, it is dissolved
in water and treated with bone-black. The solution is then
evaporated to a sirup, and this poured into a mixture of equal
parts of anhydrous alcohol and ether. In this way the new compound
is obtained as a very fine, pure white powder which rapidly
settles. It has much the appearance of starch. Under the microscope
it is perfectly amorphous. In the air it deliquesces much more
rapidly than ignited calcium chloride.</p>

<p>Treated with dilute mineral acids or oxalic acid on the
water-bath gallisin is transformed into dextrose. It does not
ferment when treated in water solution with fresh yeast. The
analyses led to the formula
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>10</sub>. When treated under
pressure with three times its weight of acetic anhydride at
130-140&deg; it dissolves perfectly. From the solution a product
was separated which on analysis gave results agreeing with the
formula
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O)<sub>
6</sub>. The substance appears therefore to be
hexacetylgallisin.</p>

<p>Physiological experiments on lower animals and human beings
demonstrated clearly that gallisin has neither directly nor
indirectly any injurious effect on the health.&mdash;<i>Berichte

<h2>THE COMBINING WEIGHTS, VOLUMES, AND SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF
ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS.</h2>

<p>Under the title of "Figures Worth Studying," Mr. William Farmer,
of New York, read a paper before a recent meeting of the Society of
Gas Lighting, from which the <i>American Gas Light Journal</i>
gives the following:</p>

<p>I have prepared the following table, which contains some of the
elements and compounds, with their combining weights, volumes, and
specific gravities. When the combining weight of any of these
elements and compounds is taken in pounds, then the gas or vapor
therefrom will always occupy about 377.07 cubic feet of space, at
60&deg; Fahr. and 30 inches barometer. If we divide this constant
377.07 by the combining weight of any of the substances, then the
quotient will be the number of cubic feet per pound of the same. If
we divide the combining weight of any of the substances given in
the table by 2, then the quotient will give the density of the
same, as compared with hydrogen. If we divide the combining weight
of any of the substances by the constant 28.87, then the quotient
will be the specific gravity of the gas or vapor therefrom, as
compared with air. All the calculations are based on the atomic
weights which are now generally adopted by the majority of
chemists.</p>

<h2>EMERALD-GREEN: ITS PROPERTIES AND MANUFACTURE.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>

<h3>By ROBERT GALLOWAY, M.R.I.A.</h3>

<p>The poisonous effects of wall-paper stained with emerald-green
(aceto-arsenite of copper) appears to be a very favorite topic in
many journals; it is continually reappearing in one form or another
in different publications, especially medical ones; there has
recently appeared a short reference to it under the title, "The
Poisonous Effect of Wall-paper." As some years ago I became
practically acquainted with its properties and manufacture, a few
observations on these subjects may not be without interest.</p>

<p>In the paragraph referred to, it is stated that the poisonous
effect of this pigment cannot be <i>entirely</i> due to its mere
mechanical detachment from the paper. This writer therefore
attributes the poisonous effects to the formation of the hydrogen
compound of arsenic, viz., arseniureted hydrogen (AsH<sub>3</sub>);
the hydrogen, for the formation of this compound, being generated,
the writer thinks probable, "by the joint action of moisture and
organic matters, viz., of substances used in fixing to walls papers
impregnated with arsenic." In some of our chemical manuals, Dr.
Kolbe's "Inorganic Chemistry," for example, it is also stated that
arseniureted hydrogen is formed by the <i>fermentation</i> of the
starch-paste employed for fastening the paper to the walls. It is
perfectly obvious that the fermentation of the starch-paste must
cease after a time, and therefore the poisonous effects of the
paper must likewise cease if its injurious effects are caused by
the fermentation. I do not think that arseniureted hydrogen could
be formed under the <i>conditions</i>, for the oxygen compound of
arsenic is in a state of combination, and the compound is in a dry
solid state and not in solution and the affinities of the two
elements&mdash;arsenic and hydrogen&mdash;for each other are so
exceedingly weak that they cannot be made to unite directly except
they are both set free at the same moment in presence of each
other. Further, for the formation of this hydrogen compound by the
fermentation of the starch, or by the growth of minute fungi, the
<i>entire</i> compound must be broken up, and therefore the pigment
would become discolored; but aceto-arsenite of copper</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span>(3CuAs<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>+Cu(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>
2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<br>
</span></div>
</div>

<p>is a very stable compound, not readily undergoing decomposition,
and is consequently a very permanent color. It has also been not
unfrequently stated that the injurious effects of this pigment are
due to the arsenious oxide volatilizing from the other constituents
of the compound. This volatilization would likewise cause a
breaking up of the entire compound, and would consequently cause a
discoloration of the paper; but the volatilization of this arsenic
compound is in every respect most improbable.</p>

<p>The injurious effects, if any, of this pigment must therefore be
due to its mechanical detachment from the paper; but has it ever
been conclusively proved that persons who inhabit rooms the
wall-paper of which is stained with emerald-green suffer from
arsenical poisoning? If it does occur, then the effects of what may
be termed hom&oelig;opathic doses of this substance are totally
different from the effects which arise from larger doses. During
the packing of this substance in its dry state in the factory,
clouds of its dust ascend in the air, and during the time I had to
do with its manufacture I never heard that any of the factory hands
suffered, nor did I suffer, from arsenical poisoning. If there is
any abrasion of the skin the dust produces a sore, and also the
delicate lining of the nostrils is apt to be affected. It is in
this way it acts in large doses; I am therefore very skeptical as
to its supposed poisonous effects when wall-paper is stained with
it.</p>

<p>Different methods are given in works on chemistry for the
manufacture of this pigment, but as they do not agree in every
respect with the method which was followed in English color
factories some years ago, it will be as well, for the full
elucidation of the manufacture of this substance, to briefly recite
some of these methods before describing the one that was, and
probably is still, in use; and I will afterward describe a method
which I invented, and which is practically superior to any other,
both in the rapidity with which the color can be formed, and for
producing it at a less cost.</p>

<p>It is stated in Watts' "Dictionary of Chemistry" that it is
"prepared on a large scale by mixing arsenious acid with cupric
acetate and water. Five parts of verdigris are made up to a thin
paste, and added to a boiling solution of 4 parts or rather more of
arsenious acid in 50 parts of water. The boiling must be well kept
up, otherwise the precipitate assumes a yellow-green color, from
the formation of copper arsenite; in that case acetic acid must be
added, and the boiling continued a few minutes longer. The
precipitate then becomes crystalline, and acquires the fine green
color peculiar to the aceto-arsenite." I do not know from personal
knowledge, but I have always understood that the copper salt
employed in its manufacture in France is the acetate. This would
account, in my opinion, for the larger crystalline flakes in which
it is obtained in France than can be produced by the English method
of manufacturing it. Cupric acetate is never employed, I believe,
in England&mdash;the much cheaper copper salt, the sulphate, being
always employed.</p>

<p>In "Miller's Chemistry" it is stated it "may be obtained by
<i>boiling</i> solutions of arsenious anhydride and cupric acetate,
and adding to the mixture an equal bulk of <i>cold</i> water." Why
it should be recommended to add <i>cold water</i>, I am at a loss
to understand.</p>

<p>In Drs. Roscoe and Schorlemmer's large work on "Chemistry," and
in the English edition of "Wagner's Handbook of Chemical
Technology," edited by Mr. Crookes, the process as described by Dr.
Ehrmann in the "Ann. Pharm.," xii., 92, is given. It is thus stated
in Wagner's work: "This pigment is prepared by first separately
dissolving equal parts by weight of arsenious acid and neutral
acetate of copper in boiling water, and next mixing these solutions
while boiling. There is immediately formed a flocculent olive-green
colored precipitate of arsenite of copper, while the supernatant
liquid contains free acetic acid. After a while the precipitate
becomes gradually crystalline, at the same time forming a beautiful
green pigment, which is separated from the liquid by filtration,
and after washing and carefully drying is ready for use. The mode
of preparing this pigment on a large scale was originally devised
by M. Braconnot, as follows: 15 kilos. of sulphate of copper are
dissolved in the smallest quantity of boiling water, and mixed with
a boiling and concentrated solution of arsenite of soda or potassa,
so prepared as to contain 20 kilos. of arsenious acid. There is
immediately formed a dirty greenish-colored precipitate which is
converted into Schweinfurt green by the addition of some 15 liters
of concentrated wood-vinegar. This having been done, the
precipitate is immediately filtered off and washed."</p>

<p>As I have already stated, the copper salt used in the
manufacture of this pigment in England is the sulphate, and it is
carried out pretty much according to Braconnot's method as
described by Dr Ehrmann; but any one would infer, from reading his
description of the manufacturing process, that the compound,
aceto-arsenite of copper, was formed almost immediately after the
addition of the acetic acid, a higher or lower atmospheric
temperature having no effect in hastening or retarding the
formation. Furthermore, it is not stated whether the compound forms
more readily in an acid or neutral solution, or whether it can or
cannot be formed in a neutral one; now both these points are
important to notice in describing its manufacture. As regards the
former I shall notice it presently, and, as far as my knowledge
extends, the pigment will not form when the solution is
neutral.</p>

<p>The operation is conducted in the following manner in the
factory: The requisite quantity of sulphate of copper is placed in
a large wooden vat, and hot water added to dissolve it; the
requisite quantity of arsenic (arsenious anhydride) and carbonate
of soda, the latter not in quantity quite sufficient to neutralize
the whole of the sulphuric acid set free from the sulphate of
copper on the precipitation of the copper as arsenite, are placed
in another wooden vessel; water is then added, and the formation of
the arsenite of soda and its solution are aided by the introduction
of steam into the liquid. When complete solution has been effected
the arsenic solution is run off into the vat containing the
solution of the sulphate of copper, arsenite of copper being at
once precipitated. The necessary quantity of acetic acid is
afterward added. In <i>warm</i> weather the formation of the
aceto-arsenite soon commences after the addition of the vinegar;
but, even in that case, it takes a week or more to have the whole
of a big batch of arsenite converted into the aceto-arsenite; and
perfect conversion is necessary, as the presence of a very minute
quantity of unchanged arsenite lowers very much the price of the
emerald pigment, and a by no means large quantity renders the
pigment unsalable, owing to its dirty yellowish-green color. In
cold weather a much longer time is required for its complete
conversion; even at the end of a fortnight or three weeks there
frequently remains sufficient unconverted arsenite to affect
seriously the selling price of the color; when this occurs the
manufacturer generally removes these last traces by a most wasteful
method viz, by adding a quantity of free sulphuric acid. The acid
of course dissolves the arsenite, but it dissolves in very much
larger quantities the aceto-arsenite; and this costly solution is
not utilized, but is run into the factory sewer.</p>

<p>By my method of manufacturing it, it can be produced in winter
as well as in summer in one or two hours, and the quantity of free
acid required for its formation is reduced to the lowest amount. I
proceed as follows: After having dissolved in hot water the
requisite quantity of cupric sulphate, I decompose one-fourth of
this salt by adding just sufficient of a solution of carbonate of
soda to precipitate the copper, in that quantity of the sulphate,
as carbonate. I then add just sufficient acetic acid to convert the
carbonate into acetate. I have now got in solution&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>3CuSO<sub>4</sub> +
Cu(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,<br>

</div>

<p>and I have to transform it into&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza"><span>3CuAs<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> +
Cu(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<br>
</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is at once seen that I have got the requisite quantity of
acetate formed. I next dissolve the requisite quantity of arsenious
anhydride in an amount of carbonate of soda <i>rather less</i> than
is sufficient to neutralize the acid in the remaining cupric
sulphate, and I then bring the solution to or near the
boiling-point by introducing steam into it; the arsenic is
dissolved not in the same vessel as the copper salt, but in a
separate one. When the arsenic solution is fully heated, a small
current of it is allowed to flow into the vat containing the copper
salts, and brisk stirring is kept up in the vat. The emerald green
is at once formed; but if there should be the slightest formation
of any arsenite, the flow of the arsenic solution is at once
stopped until every trace of the arsenite has been converted; the
arsenic solution is then allowed to flow in again, with the same
precautions as before; in this way a large batch of emerald-green
can he formed in one or two hours, without containing the slightest
trace of the arsenite. I keep the arsenic solution near the
boiling-point during the whole of the time it is flowing into the
other vessel. By varying the proportions of water I could either
make it coarse or fine, as I wished, which is an important matter
to have complete control over in its manufacture.</p>

<p>Two points of interest occurred to me during the time I was
occupied with the research, which I had not time to complete; one
was whether the aceto-arsenite can be formed, adopting the old
method for its formation, if there is more than a certain quantity
of water; from some experiments I made in this direction I was
inclined to the opinion it could not. I have already stated that
emerald-green is soluble to a certain extent in acids, and that it
is formed in a more or less acid solution; consequently a varying
amount of the pigment is always lost by being dissolved in the
supernatant liquid. To prevent to a certain extent this loss I
precipitated the copper from it as arsenite; but I was not
successful in the few experiments I had time to make on this part
of the subject of reconverting the copper arsenite thus obtained
into the aceto-arsenite by the addition of acetic
acid.&mdash;<i>Jour. of Science.</i></p>

<h2>ANALYSIS OF ZINC ASH AND CALCINED PYRITES BY MEANS OF AMMONIUM
CARBONATE.</h2>

<p>In a recent issue of the <i>Chemiker Zeitung</i> Dr. Kosmann has
reported an analytical method for the examination of zinciferous
products; according to this report, the ash and flue dust produced
by the extraction of zinc from its ore comprise:</p>

<ol>
<li>Zinc dust, from the distillation of zinc,</li>

<li>Flue dust, condensed in chambers of zinc furnaces with
Kleemann's receivers,</li>

<li>Zinc ash, of various assortments, from iron blast
furnaces.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these, zinc dust is the only ready product which is, as color
or reducing agent, employed in analytical and technical processes.
Its value, when serving the latter purpose, is determined by the
percentage of finely divided metallic zinc and cadmium contained
therein; of equal reducing power is cadmium, generally associating
zinc; injurious, and therefore uneffective, are zinc oxide and
oxides of other metals, also metallic lead.</p>

<p>Flue dust, condensed in chambers of zinc furnaces with
Kleemann's receivers, is employed with zinc ores in the extraction
of zinc, and in small quantities as substitute for zinc white; its
commercial value is similarly estimated as that of zinc ores.</p>

<p>The various modifications of zinciferous flue ashes from blast
furnaces are an object for continual demand, being both a valuable
material for the production of zinc and, in its superior qualities,
a desirable pigment. In the regeneration of zinc the presence of
foreign substances is of some concern; detrimental are lead,
sulphur, and sulphuric acid in form of lead, zinc, and lime
sulphate.</p>

<p>The chemico-technical analysis of these products has until
recently been confined to the volumetric determination of zinc by
means of sodium sulphide (Schaffner's method). But as a remnant of
sulphur, as sulphuric acid, in roasted blende causes a material
loss during distillation, and otherwise being induced to produce a
zinc free of lead, the estimation of sulphur, sulphuric acid, and
lead became necessary. These impurities are determined by
well-known methods; sulphur is oxidized and precipitated with
barium chloride, lead by sulphuric acid and alcohol. The
examination of zinc dust, when used for the regeneration of metal,
determines the quantity of zinc resident therein, and employed as
reducing agent, the quantity of metal which causes the generation
of hydrogen. Cadmium, showing the same deportment, must also be
considered as well as lead and arsenic.</p>

<p>A most complete and rapidly working method for the examination
of zinciferous products has originated with the application of
neutral ammonium carbonate as solvent. A solution of this
preparation is made, according to H. Rose, by dissolving 230 grm.
commercial ammon carbonate in 180 c.c. ammoniacal liquor of 0.92
s.g., and, by addition of water, augmenting it to one liter.</p>

<p>This solution dissolves the metallic components, their oxides,
and basic zinc sulphate, and transfers cadmium and lead oxide, also
lead, magnesium, and lime sulphate, into insoluble carbonates. Iron
and manganese, when present as protoxide, are dissolved; of iron
sesquioxide but traces, and of cadmium oxide <i>in statu
nascendi</i> a small portion enter into solution. The solution of
ammonium carbonate contains in each 10 c.c. 1 grm. ammonia, which
dissolves 1.5 grm. zinc.</p>

<p>The sample for examination is moistened with water and mixed
with an adequate volume of the solvent, is digested at 50-60&deg;
C. until complete decomposition is effected. The heating of the
liquid prevents the solution of iron, manganese, and cadmium. The
content, sediment and liquid, is thrown on a filter and washed with
hot water to which a small quantity of the solvent has been added.
When the solution contains iron and manganese, it is separated by
decantation from the sediment and oxidized with bromine (according
to the method of Nic-Wolff) until a flocculent precipitate of iron
sesquioxide and manganese dioxide becomes visible; it is united
with the original residue and filtered.</p>

<p>The filtrate is diluted till it appears cloudy, boiled to expel
ammonia, tested with sodium sulphide upon the presence of zinc,
and, when freed of all zinc, decanted. The precipitate of zinc
carbonate is filtered, exhausted with water, transferred into zinc
oxide by ignition, and weighed. The gravimetric method can be
substituted by the volumetric by introducing a solution of sodium
sulphide of known strength into the ammoniacal filtrate. On
dividing the filtered liquid into various equal portions other
substances, arsenic and sulphuric acid, can be determined from the
same sample. For this purpose the filtrate is concentrated; divided
into two equal portions, one of which is acidified and treated with
hydrogen sulphide for the determination of arsenic, the other is
acidified and used for the estimation of sulphuric acid by means of
barium chloride. The original residue is dissolved in muriatic or
acetic acid and filtered. The lead of the filtered liquid is thrown
down by sulphuric acid, and alcohol, and cadmium, after dissipation
of alcohol into gas, precipitated by hydrogen sulphide. Iron,
manganese, alumina, and other substances present in the solution
are determined by known methods.</p>

<p>It is manifest that the determination of substances&mdash;zinc,
lead, and sulphuric acid&mdash;which are of importance in technical
analysis of zinc ash, can be executed by this method within a
comparatively short time. The application of ammonium carbonate as
solvent has the advantage, over the application of ammonia, that it
is a far better solvent, that it decomposes insoluble basic
sulphates, and that the remaining carbonates are readily dissolved
by acids.</p>

<p>The decomposition of zinc dust is accompanied by a lively
evolution of gas; it is therefore necessary to continue the
digestion of the sample till no more hydrogen is given off. Zinc
dust contains both metals and their oxides, and methods which, from
the volume of hydrogen generated, determine indirectly the
percentage of metallic zinc do not give the real composition of the
zinc dust. For the determination of the metallic components the
material is digested with a solution of copper sulphate, which
dissolves zinc and cadmium; the liquid is filtered, acidified, and
decomposed with hydrogen sulphide, or treated with a solution of
ammonium carbonate. The use of cupric chloride is not advisable, as
it corrodes lead, and gives rise to the formation of soluble
chloride of lead, which complicates the separation of zinc from
cadmium. The best mode of operation is the following: Both copper
sulphate and zinc dust are weighed separately, the former is
dissolved in water and the latter introduced into the solution of
copper sulphate in small portions until it appears colorless.
During the operation the vessel is freely shaken, lumps are
comminuted with a glass rod, and a few drops of the liquid are
ultimately tested with hydrogen sulphide or ammonia. The remainder
of zinc dust is then weighed, and its value deducted from the
original weight. Zinc and cadmium of the filtrate are determined as
above. On repeating this method several times most satisfactory
results are obtained.</p>

<p>Another mode of operating is to employ an excess of copper
sulphate and to determine the copper dissolved in the filtrate. The
separation of copper from cadmium being difficult and laborious,
and the volumetric estimation with potassium cyanide not
practicable, it is not prudent to apply this method.</p>

<p>When calcined zinciferous pyrites have to be examined, the
estimation of zinc is similar to that employed in the analysis of
zinc ore. The sample is exhausted with water, filtered, and, to
eliminate calcium sulphate and basic iron sulphate, evaporated to
dryness. It is then dissolved in a small quantity of alcohol and
water, refiltered, and the filtrate decomposed with ammonium
carbonate. The original residue is treated with a solution of
ammonium carbonate, which dissolves arsenious acid and basic zinc
sulphate, filtered, and united with the first filtrate. When iron
and manganese are present, the filtrates are treated with bromine.
The united filtrates are boiled or examined volumetrically with
sodium sulphide.</p>

<h2>PETROLEUM AS FUEL IN LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>

<h3>By Mr. THOMAS URQUHART.</h3>

<p>Comparing naphtha refuse and anthracite, the former has a
theoretical evaporative power of 16.2 lb. of water per lb. of fuel,
and the latter of 12.2 lb., at a pressure of 8 atm. or 120 lb. per
square inch; hence petroleum has, weight for weight, 33 per cent.
higher evaporative value than anthracite. Now in locomotive
practice a mean evaporation of from 7 lb. to 7&frac12; lb. of water
per lb. of anthracite is about what is generally obtained, thus
giving about 60 per cent. efficiency, while 40 per cent. of the
heating power is unavoidably lost. But with petroleum an
evaporation of 12.25 lb. is practically obtained, giving 12.25/16.2
= 75 per cent. efficiency. Thus in the first place petroleum is
theoretically 33 per cent. superior to anthracite in evaporative
power; and secondly, its useful effect is 25 per cent. greater,
being 75 percent. instead of 60 percent.; while, thirdly, weight
for weight, the practical evaporative value of petroleum must be
reckoned as at least from (12.25 - 7.50)/7.50 = 63 per cent. to
(12.25 - 7.00)/7.00 = 75 per cent. higher than that of
anthracite.</p>

<p><i>Spray injector.</i>&mdash;Steam not superheated, being the
most convenient for injecting the spray of liquid fuel into the
furnace, it remains to be proved how far superheated steam or
compressed air is really superior to ordinary saturated steam,
taken from the highest point inside the boiler by a special
internal pipe. In using several systems of spray injectors for
locomotives, the author invariably noticed the impossibility of
preventing leakage of tubes, accumulation of soot, and inequality
of heating of the fire box. The work of a locomotive boiler is very
different from that of a marine or stationary boiler, owing to the
frequent changes of gradient on the line, and the frequent
stoppages at stations. These conditions render firing with
petroleum very difficult; and were it not for the part played by
properly arranged brickwork inside the fire box, the spray jet
alone would be quite inadequate. Hitherto the efforts of engineers
have been mainly directed toward arriving at the best kind of
"spray injector," for so minutely subdividing a jet of petroleum
into a fine spray, by the aid of steam or compressed air, as to
render it inflammable and of easy ignition. For this object nearly
all the known spray injectors have very long and narrow orifices
for petroleum as well as for steam; the width of the orifices does
not exceed from &frac12; mm. to 2 mm. or 0.02 in. to 0.08 in., and
in many instances is capable of adjustment. With such narrow
orifices it is clear that any small solid particles which may find
their way into the spray injector along with the petroleum will
foul the nozzle and check the fire. Hence in many of the steamboats
on the Caspian Sea, although a single spray injector suffices for
one furnace, two are used, in order that when one gets fouled the
other may still work; but, of course, the fouled orifices require
incessant cleaning out.</p>

<p><i>Locomotives.</i>&mdash;In arranging a locomotive for burning
petroleum, several details are required to be added in order to
render the application convenient. In the first place, for getting
up steam to begin with, a gas pipe of 1 inch internal diameter is
fixed along the outside of the boiler, and at about the middle of
its length it is fitted with a three-way cock having a screw nipple
and cap. The front end of the longitudinal pipe is connected to the
blower in the chimney, and the back end is attached to the spray
injector. Then by connecting to the nipple a pipe from a shunting
locomotive under steam, the spray jet is immediately started by the
borrowed steam, by which at the same time a draught is also
maintained in the chimney. In a fully equipped engine shed the
borrowed steam would be obtained from a fixed boiler conveniently
placed and specially arranged for the purpose of raising steam. In
practice steam can be raised from cold water to 3 atm.
pressure&mdash;45 lb. per square inch&mdash;in twenty minutes. The
use of auxiliary steam is then dispensed with, and the spray jet is
worked by steam from its own boiler; a pressure of 8 atm.&mdash;120
lb.&mdash;is thus obtained in fifty to fifty-five minutes from the
time the spray jet was first started. In daily practice, when it is
only necessary to raise steam in boilers already full of hot water,
the full pressure of 7 to 8 atm. is obtained in from twenty to
twenty-five minutes. While experimenting with liquid fuel for
locomotives, a separate tank was placed on the tender for carrying
the petroleum, having a capacity of about 3 tons. But to have a
separate tank on the tender, even though fixed in place, would be a
source of danger from the possibility of its moving forward in case
of collision. It was therefore decided, as soon as petroleum firing
was permanently introduced, to place the tank for fuel in the
tender between the two side compartments of the water tank,
utilizing the original coal space. For a six-wheeled locomotive the
capacity of the tank is 3&frac12; tons of oil&mdash;a quantity
sufficient for 250 miles, with a train of 480 tons gross exclusive
of engine and tender. In charging the tender tank with petroleum,
it is of great importance to have strainers of wire cloth in the
manhole of two different meshes, the outer one having openings,
say, of &frac14; in., the inner, say &#8539; in.; these strainers
are occasionally taken out and cleaned. If care be taken to prevent
any solid particles from entering with the petroleum, no fouling of
the spray injector is likely to occur; and even if an obstruction
should arise, the obstacle being of small size can easily be blown
through by screwing back the steam cone in the spray injector far
enough to let the solid particles pass and be blown out into the
fire-box by the steam. This expedient is easily resorted to even
when running; and no more inconvenience arises than an extra puff
of dense smoke for a moment, in consequence of the sudden admission
of too much fuel. Besides the two strainers in the manhole of the
petroleum tank on the tender, there should be another strainer at
the outlet valve inside the tank, having a mesh of &#8531; in.
holes.</p>

<p><i>Driving locomotives.</i>&mdash;In lighting up, certain
precise rules have to be followed, in order to prevent explosion of
any gas that may have accumulated in the fire box. Such explosions
do often take place through negligence; but they amount simply to a
puff of gas, driving smoke out through the ash-pan dampers, without
any disagreeably loud report. This is all prevented by adhering to
the following simple rules: First clear the spray nozzle of water
by letting a small quantity of steam blow through, with the ash-pan
doors open; at the same time start the blower in the chimney for a
few seconds, and the gas, if any, will be immediately drawn up the
chimney. Next place on the bottom of the combustion chamber a piece
of cotton waste, or a handful of shavings saturated with petroleum
and burning with a flame. Then by opening first the steam valve of
the spray injector, and next the petroleum valve gently, the very
first spray of oil coming on the flaming waste immediately ignites
without any explosion whatever; after which the quantity of fuel
can be increased at pleasure. By looking at the top of the chimney,
the supply of petroleum can be regulated by observing the smoke.
The general rule is to allow a transparent light smoke to escape,
thus showing that neither too much air is being admitted nor too
little. The combustion is quite under the control of the driver,
and the regulation can be so effected as to prevent smoke
altogether. While running, it is indispensable that the driver and
fireman should act together, the latter having at his side of the
engine the four handles for regulating the fire, namely, the steam
wheel and the petroleum wheel for the spray injector, and the two
ash-pan door handles in which there are notches for regulating the
air admission. Each alteration in the position of the reversing
lever or screw, as well as in the degree of opening of the steam
regulator or the blast pipe, requires a corresponding alteration of
the fire. Generally the driver generally passes the word when he
intends shutting off steam, so that the alteration in the firing
can be effected before the steam is actually shut off; and in this
way the regulation of the fire and that of the steam are virtually
done together. All this care is necessary to prevent smoke, which
is nothing less than a waste of fuel. When, for instance, the train
arrives at the top of a bank, which it has to go down with the
brakes on, exactly at the moment of the driver shutting off the
steam and shifting the reversing lever into full forward gear, the
petroleum and steam are shut off from the spray injector, the
ash-pan doors are closed, and if the incline be a long one, the
revolving iron damper over the chimney top is moved into position,
closing the chimney, though not hermetically. The accumulated heat
is thereby retained in the fire-box; and the steam even rises in
pressure, from the action of the accumulated heat alone. As soon as
the train reaches the bottom of the incline and steam is again
required, the first thing done is to uncover the chimney top; then
the steam is turned on to the spray injector, and next a small
quantity of petroleum is admitted, but without opening the ash-pan
doors, a small fire being rendered possible by the entrance of air
around the spray injector, as well as by possible leakage past the
ash-pan doors. The spray immediately coming in contact with the hot
chamber ignites without any audible explosion; and the ash-pan
doors are finally opened, when considerable power is required, or
when the air otherwise admitted is not sufficient to support
complete combustion. By looking at the fire through the sight hole
it can always be seen at night whether the fire is white or dusky;
in fact, with altogether inexperienced men it was found that after
a few trips they could become quite expert in firing with
petroleum. The better men contrive to burn less fuel than others,
simply by greater care in attending to all the points essential to
success. At present seventy-two locomotives are running with
petroleum firing; ten of them are passenger engines, seventeen are
eight-wheel coupled goods engines, and forty-five are six-wheel
coupled. As might be expected, several points have arisen which
must be dealt with in order to insure success. For instance, the
distance ring between the plates around the firing door is apt to
leak, in consequence of the intense heat driven against it, and the
absence of water circulation; it is therefore either protected by
having the brick arch built up against it, or, better still, it is
taken out altogether when the engines are in for repairs, and a
flange joint is substituted, similar to what is now used in the
engines of the London and Northwestern Railway. This arrangement
gives better results, and occasions no trouble whatever.</p>

<p><i>Storage of petroleum.</i>&mdash;The length of line now worked
with petroleum is from Tsaritsin to Burnack, 291 miles. There is a
main iron reservoir for petroleum at each of the four engine sheds,
namely at Tsaritsin, Archeda, Filonoff, and Borisoglebsk. Each
reservoir is 66 ft. internal diameter and 24 ft. high, and when
full holds about 2,050 tons. The method of charging the reservoir,
which stands a good way from the line, and is situated at a
convenient distance from all dwelling houses and buildings, is as
follows: On a siding specially prepared for the purpose are placed
ten cistern cars full of oil, the capacity of each being about ten
tons. From each of these cars a connection is made by a flexible
India rubber pipe to one of ten stand pipes which project 1 ft.
above the ground line. Parallel with the rails is laid a main pipe,
with which the ten stand pipes are all connected, thus forming one
general suction main. About the middle of the length of the main,
which is laid underground and covered with sawdust or other
non-conducting material, is fixed a Blake steam pump. As soon as
all the ten connections are made with the cistern cars, the pump is
set to work, and in about one hour the whole of the cars are
discharged into the main reservoir, the time depending of course
upon the capacity of the pump. All the pipes used are of malleable
iron, lap-welded, and of 5 in. internal diameter, having screwed
coupling muffs for making the connections. At each engine shed, in
addition to the main storage reservoir, there is a smaller
distributing tank, which is erected at a sufficient height to
supply the tenders, and very much resembles the ordinary water
tanks. These distributing tanks are circular, about 8&frac12; ft.
diameter and 6 ft. high, and of &frac14; in. plates; their inside
mean area is calculated exactly, and a scale graduated in inches
stands in the middle of the tank; a glass with scale is used
outside in summer time. Each inch in height on the scale is
converted into cubic feet, and then by means of a table is
converted into Russian poods, according to the specific gravity at
various temperatures. As it would be superfluous to graduate the
table for each separate degree of temperature, the columns in the
table show the weights for every 8 degrees Reaumur, which is quite
sufficient: namely, from 24 deg. to 17 deg., from 16 deg. to 9
deg., and so on, down to -24 deg.; the equivalent Fahrenheit range
being from 86 deg. down to -22 deg. Suppose the filling of a tender
tank draws off a height of 27 in. from the distributing tank, at a
temperature of say -20 deg. R., these figures are shown by the
table to correspond with 200.61 poods = 7,245 lb., or 3.23 tons, of
petroleum. This arrangement does very well in practice; both the
quantity and the temperature are entered on the driver's fuel bill
at the time of his taking in his supply.</p>

<p><i>Engines.</i>&mdash;The engines used in the trials were built
by Borsig, of Berlin, Schneider, of Creusot, and the Russian
Mechanical and Mining Company, of St. Petersburg. Their main
dimensions and weights were about the same, as follows, all of them
having six wheels coupled, and 36 tons adhesive weight; as

<p>The preceding table shows the results of comparative trials made
in winter with different sorts of fuel, under exactly similar
conditions as to type of engine, profile of line, and load of
train. Two sets of comparative trials were made, both of them in
winter. The three engines used were some of those built by
Schneider. In comparison with anthracite, the economy in favor of
petroleum refuse was 41 per cent. in weight, and 55 per cent. in
cost. With bituminous coal there was a difference of 49 per cent.
in favor of petroleum as to weight and 61 per cent. as to cost. As
compared with wood petroleum was 50 per cent. cheaper. At a speed
of fourteen miles an hour up an incline of 1 in 125 the steam
pressure was easily kept up at 9 to 9&frac12; atm. with a No. 9
injector feeding the boiler all the time.</p>

<p>Up to the present time the author has altered seventy-two
locomotives to burn petroleum; and from his own personal
observations made on the foot plate with considerable frost he is
satisfied that no other fuel can compare with petroleum either for
locomotives or for other purposes. In illustration of its safety in
case of accident, a photograph was exhibited of an accident that
occurred on the author's line on 30th December, 1883, when a
locomotive fired with petroleum ran down the side of an embankment,
taking the train after it; no explosion or conflagration of any
kind took place under such trying circumstances, thus affording
some proof of the safety of the petroleum refuse in this mode of
firing. Although it is scarcely possible that petroleum firing will
ever be of use for locomotives on the ordinary railways of
coal-bearing England, yet the author is convinced chat, even in
such a country, its employment would be an enormous boon on
underground lines.</p>

<p class="ctr">KILN FOR BURNING CHARCOAL.</p>

<p>In answer to the inquiry of a correspondent about charcoal
making, we offer two illustrations that show a method of
manufacture differing from that usually adopted, which is that of
burning on the bare ground, and covering with soil or sods to
exclude the air. These kilns are made of brick, one course being
sufficient, bands of iron or timber framework being added to
strengthen the brickwork with greater economy. The usual style is
conical, and the size is 24 feet in diameter, with an equal height,
holding about 40 cords of wood. The difference in price is 1&#8539;
d. per bushel in favor of these kilns as compared with the usual
mounds, the burner being furnished with the use of the kilns, and
the timber standing, the kiln burning costing 2&#8539; d., and the
other 3&frac14; d. The kilns must be lined to about halfway up with
fire-brick, the cost of which will vary with the locality, but will
be about &pound;200, and as 40 to 50 bushels of coal have been made
per cord the extra yield on good charcoal and the lessening of the
cost of making soon covers any extra outlay on the cost of the
kilns. The wall of the kiln is carried up nearly straight for 6
feet, when it is drawn in, so as to become bluntly conical. Upon
the top a plate of iron is fastened in the manner of the keystone
of an arch, and bands of iron are passed round the kiln and drawn
tight with screw bolts and nuts to strengthen it. Double doors of
sheet-iron are made at the bottom and near the tops, by which it is
either filled or emptied, and a few air-holes (B), which may be
stopped with loose bricks, left in the bottom. The second figure
shows a kiln of another shape made to burn 3,000 bushels of
charcoal, or about 80 cords of wood. The shape is a parallelogram,
having an arched roof, and it is strengthened by a framework of
timber 10 inches square. As the pressure of the gas is sometimes
very great, the walls must be built a brick and a half thick to
prevent their bursting. The usual size is 16 feet wide and high,
and 40 feet in length, outside measure. The time occupied in
filling, burning, and emptying a small cone is about three weeks,
and four weeks is required for the larger ones.&mdash;<i>The

<h2>ENTRANCE, TIDDINGTON HOUSE, OXON.</h2>

<p>Our illustration is a view of the entrance facade to Tiddington
House, Oxfordshire, the residence of the Rev. Joshua Bennett. The
house is an old building of the Georgian period, and though
originally plain and unpretentious, its bold coved cornices under
the eaves, its rubbed and shaped arches, moulded strings, and thick
sash bars, made it of considerable interest to the admirers of the
"Queen Anne" school of architecture, and led to the adoption of
that style in the alterations and additions made last year, of
which the work shown in our illustration formed a small part.
Between the "entrance facade" and the wall of the house there is a
space of some twenty feet in length, which is inclosed by a
substantially built conservatory-like erection of Queen Anne
design, forming an outer hall.</p>

<h2>NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE BICHROMATE OF POTASH PILE.</h2>

<p>Since Poggendorff in 1842 thought of substituting in the Bunsen
battery a solution of bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid for
nitric acid, and of thus making a single liquid pile of it, in
suppressing the porous vessel, his idea has been taken up a
considerable number of times. Some rediscovered it simply, while
others, who were better posted in regard to the work of their
predecessors, took Poggendorff's pile as he conceived it, and,
considering the future that was in store for it, thought only of
modifying it in order to render it better. Among these, Mr. Grenet
was one of the first to present the bichromate of potash pile under
a truly practical form. As long ago as 1856, in fact, he gave it
the form that is still in use, and that is known as the bottle
pile. Thus constructed, this pile, as is well known, presents a
feeble internal resistance, and a greater electro-motive power than
the Bunsen element. Unfortunately, its energy rapidly decreases,
and the alteration of the liquid, as well as the large deposit of
oxide of chromium that occurs on the positive electrode, prevents
its being employed in experiments of quite long duration. Mr.
Grenet, it is true, obviated these two defects by first renewing
the liquid slowly and continuously, and causing a current of air to
bubble up in the pile so as to detach the oxide of chromium in
measure as the deposit formed. Thus improved, the bichromate pile
was employed on a large scale in the lighting of the Comptoir
d'Escompte. In an extensive application like this latter, the use
of compressed air for renewing the liquid can be easily adapted to
the bichromate pile, as the number of elements is great enough to
allow of the putting in of all the piping necessary; but when it is
only desired to use this pile for laboratory purposes, and when
there is need of but a small number of elements, it is impossible
to adopt Mr. Grenet's elements in the form required by an electric
lighting installation. It becomes absolutely necessary, then, to
come back to a simpler form, and attempt at the same time to
obviate the defects which are inherent to its very principle. In
accordance with this idea, it will be well to point out the
arrangement adopted by Mr. Courtot for his bichromate of potash
piles&mdash;an arrangement that is very simple, but, sufficiently
well worked out to render the use of it convenient in a
laboratory.</p>

</a></p>

<p class="ctr">Fig. 1.&mdash;COURTOT'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE
BICHROMATE PILE.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 gives the most elementary form. It consists of an earthen
vessel into which dip four carbon plates connected with each other
by a copper ring which carries one of the terminals. In the center
there is a cylindrical porous vessel that contains a very dilute
and feebly acidulated solution of bichromate of potash into which
dips a prism of zinc, which may be lifted by means of a rod when
the pile ceases to operate. It is true that the presence of the
porous vessel in the bichromate of potash element increases the
internal resistance, but, as an offset, although it decreases the
discharge, it secures constancy and quite a long duration for
it.</p>

<p>The elements thus constituted may be grouped, to the number of
six, in a frame analogous to that shown in the engraving, and, sum
total, form a small sized battery adapted to the current
experiments of the laboratory, and capable of supplying two small
four volt lamps for ten or twelve hours. We have had occasion to
make use of these elements for the graduation of galvanometers,
and, after ascertaining the constancy of the discharge, have found
that the internal resistance of each couple is nearly 0.175 ohm,
with an electro-motive force of two volts. As may be seen, these
elements should, in general, all be mounted for tension, as they
are in the figure, inasmuch as the mobility of the zincs permits,
according to circumstances, of employing a variable number of them
without changing anything. Moreover, with zincs amalgamated in a
special manner, the attack is imperceptible, and the work in open
circuit need scarcely to be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the qualities inherent to the arrangement that we
have just described, that defect common to all bichromate of potash
piles&mdash;the deposit of oxide of chromium upon the
carbon&mdash;is not here avoided. It occurs quite slowly, to be
sure, but it does occur, and, from this point of view, the
arrangement shown in Fig. 2 is preferable. The elements here are
composed of prismatic porcelain vessels containing, as before, the
solution and porous vessel.</p>

<p class="ctr">Fig. 3.&mdash;COURTOT'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE
BICHROMATE PILE.</p>

<p>The whole is covered with a sheet of ebonite connected with the
zinc and the two carbon plates in such a way that when the pile is
not in operation the whole can be lifted from the liquid. Under
such circumstances the deposit of oxide is notably diminished, and
the duration of the discharge is consequently greatly
increased.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 shows the details of a windlass that permits of lifting,
according to circumstances, all the elements of the same trough or
only a part of them. To effect this, the drum around which the
chain winds that carries the carbons is mounted upon a sleeve fixed
upon the axle. This latter is actuated by a winch; and a ratchet
wheel, R, joined to a click which is actuated by a spiral spring,
prevents the ebonite plates from falling back when it is desired to
place the bolt under the button, B, of the spring.</p>

<p>When it is desired to put an element out of the circuit, it is
only necessary to act with the finger upon the extremity of the
lever, D. Under the action of the latter, the piece, <i>s</i>,
which carries a groove for the passage of the screws that fix it to
the upper cross-piece, takes on a longitudinal motion and
consequently gears with the drum through the toothed sleeve, E.
When an experiment is finished the zinc may thus be lifted from the
liquid, and the deposit of oxide be prevented from forming upon the
carbon. As may be seen, the arrangements which we have just
described exhibit nothing that is particularly original. The
windlasses used for removing the elements from a pile when the
circuit is open have been employed for a long time; the bichromate
pile is itself old, and, as we said in the beginning, it has been
modified in its details a number of times. In spite of this, we
have thought it well to point out the mode of construction adopted
by Mr. Courtot, since, owing to the simplicity of the arrangements,
it renders convenient and easily manageable a pile of very great
constancy that may be utilized for supplying incandescent lamps, as
well as for the most varied experiments of the
laboratory.&mdash;<i>La Lumiere Electrique.</i></p>

<h2>THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICITY BY INDUCTION.</h2>

<p>There has been much said in recent times about the distribution
of electricity by means of induction coils, and the use of this
process has given rise to several systems that differ but little
from one another in principle.</p>

<p>The following are a few details in regard to a system due to a
Dutch engineer:</p>

<p>In the month of December, 1881, a patent relating to the
distribution of electricity was taken out in Germany and other
countries by Mr. B. Haitzema Enuma, whose system is based upon a
series of successive inductions. The primary current developed by a
dynamo-electric machine gives rise to secondary, tertiary, etc.,
currents. The principal line runs through the streets parallel with
their axes, and, when the arrangement of the places is adapted
thereto, it is closed upon the generator itself. In those frequent
cases where it is necessary to cause the line to return over a path
that it has already traversed, it is more advantageous to effect
the return through the earth or to utilize the street water mains
or gas pipes as conductors. This return arrangement may likewise be
applied to the lines of secondary, tertiary, etc., order, as may
easily be seen.</p>

<p>The induction is effected by the aid of bobbins whose interior
consists of a bundle of soft iron. The wire of the inducting
current is wound directly around this core. The wire of the induced
current is superposed upon the first and presents a large number of
spirals. It is useless to say that these wires must be perfectly
insulated from each other, as well as from the soft iron core. We
shall call primary bobbins those which are interposed in the
principal line, and secondary bobbins those in which the inducting
current is a secondary one, and so on.</p>

<p>It will be at once seen that this arrangement permits of
continuing the distribution of electricity to the interior of
buildings by the simple adjunction of one or several bobbins. Each
electric apparatus, whether it be a lamp or other mechanism, is
furnished with a special current. If the number of these apparatus
be increased, it is only necessary to increase the number of
bobbins in the same ratio, on condition, be it understood, that the
intensity of the currents remain sufficient to secure a proper
working of the apparatus in question. When such intensity
diminishes to too great a degree, the bobbin must be replaced by a
stronger one.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/5d.png"><img src=
"./images/5d_th.jpg" alt=
" DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICITY BY INDUCTION."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICITY BY INDUCTION.</p>

<p>It results from what precedes that each apparatus must be put in
in such a way as to permit, of the opening and closing of the
corresponding circuit. This arrangement, moreover, has no need of
being dependent upon the apparatus, and may just as well be
transferred to any part of this same circuit. As regards lighting,
it is preferable to employ alternating current dynamo machines; yet
there is nothing to prevent the use of continuous current ones,
provided that there is an arrangement that permits of constantly
opening and closing this same circuit. That portion of the line
which is placed under ground is insulated in the ordinary way at
the places where it is necessary. As for the underground circuit
and the induction coils connected therewith, these are protected
against all external influence, and are at the same time insulated
very economically by covering them with a coat of very fine
silicious sand mixed with asphalt.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to inspect the annexed figure to get an
accurate idea of this system of distribution. C represents the
building in which the generator of electricity, D, is placed; B,
the public street, and Q the house of a subscriber. The principal
line, E, starts from the terminals, <i>a, b</i>, of the machine,
passes through the primary bobbins, G, and is closed through the
earth at F. It will be seen that the primary current communicates
through <i>d</i> and <i>c</i> with the internal winding of the
bobbins, G, while the secondary currents, H, are connected through
<i>e</i> and <i>f</i>with the external winding. The same
arrangement is repeated for the tertiary currents, M, and the
quaternary ones, <i>o, p</i>. In the annexed example all the lines
that run parallel with the axis of the streets are closed through
the earth, while those that have a direction perpendicular thereto
enter the houses of subscribers and form a closed circuit. In the
interior of these houses the wires, as well as the induction coils,
are insulated and applied to the walls. At Q is represented the
arrangement that would have to be adopted in the case of a
structure consisting of a vestibule, <i>r</i>, and two rooms,
<i>s</i>, lighted by two electric lamps, R. In the portion of the
figure situated to the left it is easy to see the process employed
for insulating the line. A commencement is made by digging a ditch
in the street and paving the bottom of it with bricks. Upon these
latter there is laid a mixture of sand and asphalt, and then the
wires and bobbins are put in, and the whole is finally covered with
a new insulating layer.</p>

<p>It is a simple statement that we make here, and it is therefore
not for us to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the
system. If we are to believe Mr. Enuma, the advantages are very
numerous, to wit: (1) The cables have no need of being of large
size; (2) the intensity is the same through the entire extent of
the primary circuit, secondary one, etc.; (3) the resistance is
invariable in all portions of the line; (4) the apparatus are
independent of each other, and consequently there may be a
disturbance in one or several of them without the others suffering
therefrom; (5) either a strong or weak luminous intensity may be
produced, since, that depends only upon the size of the coil
employed; (6) there is no style of lamp that may not be used, since
each lamp is mounted upon a special circuit; (7) any number of
lamps may be lighted or extinguished without the others being
influenced thereby; (8) when a fire or other accident happens in a
house, it in no wise interferes with the service in the rest of the
line; (9) the system could, were it required, be connected with any
other kind of existing line; and (10) the cost of installation is
infinitely less than that of a system of gas pipes embracing the
same extent of ground.&mdash;<i>La Lumiere Electrique.</i></p>

<h2>ELECTRICITY APPLIED TO THE STUDY OF SEISMIC MOVEMENTS.</h2>

<p>Italy, with her volcanic nature, has very naturally made a
specialty of movements of the ground, or seismic perturbations. So
the larger part of the apparatus designed for such study are due to
Italians. Several of these instruments have already been, described
in this journal, and on the present occasion we shall make known a
few others that will serve to give an idea of the methods
employed.</p>

<p>For the observation of the vertical and horizontal motions of
the ground, different apparatus are required. The following is a
description of those constructed for each of such purposes by the
Brassart Brothers.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/6a.png"><img src=

</a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 1.&mdash;APPARATUS FOR THE STUDY OF HORIZONTAL
SEISMIC MOVEMENTS.</p>

<p><i>Apparatus for Studying Horizontal Movements.</i>&mdash;A
lever, (Fig. 1), movable about a horizontal axis, carries a
corrugated funnel, <i>i</i>, at one of its extremities. At the
other extremity it is provided with a counterpoise which permits of
its being exactly balanced, while not interfering with its
sensitiveness.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/6b.png"><img src=
"./images/6b_th.jpg" alt=
" FIGS. 2 AND 3.&mdash;DETAILS OF THE APPARATUS."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIGS. 2 AND 3.&mdash;DETAILS OF THE APPARATUS.</p>

<p>The opening of the funnel passes freely around a column,
<i>v</i> (Fig. 2), upon which is placed in equilibrium a rod that
terminates in a weight, P. The corrugations of the funnel carry
letters indicating the four cardinal points, and the funnel itself
is capable of revolving in such a way that the marked indications
shall always correspond to the real position of the cardinal
points. When a horizontal shock occurs, the weight, P, falls in a
direction opposite thereto, and into one of the corrugations, where
it rests, so that the direction of the shock is indicated. But, in
falling, it causes the lever, F, to tilt, and this brings about an
electric contact between the screw, <i>h</i>, and the column,
<i>n</i>, which sends a current into the electro, E, so that the
armature of the latter is attracted. In its position of rest this
armature holds a series of parts, S, A, L, which have the effect of
stopping the pendulum of a clock placed upon the same apparatus. At
the moment, then, that the armature is attracted the pendulum is
set free and the clockwork is started. As the current, at the same
time, sets a bell ringing, the observer comes and arranges the
apparatus again to await a new shock. Knowing the hour at which the
hand of the clock was stopped, he sees how long it has been in
motion again and deduces therefrom the precise moment of the
shock.</p>

<p>The small rod, <i>f</i>, which is seen at the extremity of F, is
for the purpose of allowing electricity to be dispensed with, if
need be. In this case the screw, <i>h</i>, is so regulated that F
descends farther, and that <i>f</i> may depress the armature of the
magnet just as the current would have done.</p>

</a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 4.&mdash;APPARATUS FOR THE STUDY OF VERTICAL
MOVEMENTS.</p>

<p><i>Apparatus for the Study of Vertical Movements.</i>&mdash;In
this apparatus (Fig. 4), the contact is formed between a mercury
cup, T, and a weight, D. The cup is capable of being raised and
lowered by means of a screw, so that the two parts approach each
other very closely without touching. At the moment of a vertical
shock a contact occurs between the mercury and weight, and there
results a current which, acting upon the electro, E, frees the
pendulum of the clock as in the preceding apparatus. In this case,
in order that the contact may be continuous and that the bell may
be rung, the piece, A, upon falling, sets up a permanent contact
with the part, <i>a</i> (Fig. 3).</p>

" FIG. 5.&mdash;BRASSART'S SEISMIC CLOCK."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 5.&mdash;BRASSART'S SEISMIC CLOCK.</p>

<p><i>Brassart's Seismic Clock.</i>&mdash;This apparatus is
designed for being put in connection at a distance with an
indicator like the ones just described. It is a simple clock to
which a few special devices have been added. Seismic clocks may be
classed in two categories, according as they are stopped by the
effect of a shock or are set running at the very instant one
occurs. The Messrs. Brassart have always given preference to those
of the second category, because there is no need of watching them
during a seismic calm, and because they are much more easily
constructed. It is to this class, then, that their seismic clock
belongs. It is capable of being used for domestic purposes in place
of any other clock, and of becoming a seismoscopic clock as soon as
it is put in electric communication with the seismic telltales.</p>

<p>To the cross-piece that holds the axle of the drums the
inventors have added (Fig. 5) a support formed of a strip of brass,
S, with whose extremity is jointed (at the lower part) a double
lever, A. This latter is held in a horizontal position by a small
counterpoise, <i>i</i>, so that the finger at the opposite
extremity shall prevent the pendulum, P, from swinging. To keep the
latter in a position of rest a bent lever, <i>n n'</i>, is jointed
to the upper part of the support, S. The longer arm, <i>n'</i>, of
this lever is bent forward at right angles, so that it may come
into contact with and repel the small rod of the pendulum as soon
as the lever has been lifted by means of a small cord which is
connected with the larger arm, <i>n</i>, and runs up to a small
hook, from whence it descends and makes its exit under the
clock-case.</p>

<p>In order to stop the clock, then, it is only necessary to pull
on this cord slightly, when, by moving the pendulum to the left, it
will thrust it against the inclined plane of the finger of the
lever arm, A. It is clear that the extremity of the pendulum, upon
striking against the finger, will depress it slightly and go beyond
the projection against which it remains fixed owing to the
counterpoise, <i>i</i>. The fever, <i>n n'</i>, is brought back to
its position of rest by means of a small counterpoise at the
extremity of the arm, <i>n</i>. When the lever, A, is depressed,
the pendulum escapes and sets the clock running. This depression is
effected by means of an electro-magnet, E, whose armature, which is
connected with the rod, <i>t, t</i>, lifts the arm, <i>i</i>, of
the lever, and depresses A. The wires of the two bobbins of the
electro-magnet end in two clamps, 1 and 2. The second of these
latter is insulated from the clock-case. Both communicate with the
extremities of the circuit in which is interposed the seismic
telltale that brings about a closing of the current. Having noted
the position of the hands on the dial when the clock was running,
one can deduce therefrom the moment at which the shock occurred
that set the clock in motion.</p>

<p>In addition to the parts that we have described, there are other
accessory ones, R R<i>r</i>, and a third clamp, 3, which constitute
a sort of rheotome that is designed to keep the circuit closed
after the momentary closing that is produced by the telltale has
occurred. This little mechanism is indispensable when the disturbed
telltale has also to act upon an electric bell. This rheotome,
which is very simple, is constructed as follows: A small brass rod,
R, which is screwed to the support, S, carries at its left
extremity a brass axis, X, which is insulated from the rod, R, by
means of an ivory piece. Toward the center of this small rod, the
bent lever, <i>r</i>, carries a small arm that is bent forward, and
against which abuts the axis of the pendulum, thus causing it to be
thrust toward the left when the pendulum is arrested by the
projection of the finger, A. As soon as the pendulum is set free,
the lever, <i>r</i>, redescends and places itself against the axis,
X. This latter communicates with clamp 3, which is insulated, while
the rod, R, communicates with clamp 1. The external communications
are so arranged that the circuit in which the bell is interposed
remains definitely closed when the lever, <i>r</i>, is in contact
with the rod, X.</p>

(protected by a glass tube) a weight suspended over a mercury cup
by a spring, and designed to show vertical motions. The two other
parts of the apparatus are designed for registering horizontal
motions. The first is a pendulum which causes a contact with four
distinct springs, and whose movements are watched with a spy-glass.
The second is a steel spring which carries at its upper part a
heavy ball that vibrates at the least shock. This ball is provided
with a point which is movable within a second ball, so that its
motion produces a contact. All these different contacts are
signaled or registered electrically.</p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 8.&mdash;REGISTERING APPARATUS.</p>

<p>The transmitter consists of a glass vessel supported upon a
steel point and provided beneath with a platinum circle connected
with a pile. All around this circle are four strips of platinum,
against one of which abuts the circle at every movement of the
glass. Each strip of platinum communicates, through a special wire,
with one of the electro-magnets of the registering device (Fig. 8).
This latter consists of an ordinary clock that carries three
concentric dials&mdash;one for minutes, one for hours, and one for
seconds. In a direction with the radii of these dials there are
four superposed levers, each of which is actuated by one of the
electros. On another hand, each dial is divided into four zones
that correspond to the four cardinal points. When a shock coming
from the north, for example, produces a contact, the corresponding
electro is affected, and its lever falls and marks upon each of the
dials a point in its north zone. We thus obtain the exact hour of
the shock, as well as its direction. As may be seen, the apparatus,
as regards principle, is one of the simplest of its
kind.&mdash;<i>La Lumiere Electrique.</i></p>

<h2>INDUSTRIAL MODEL OF THE REYNIER ZINC ACCUMULATOR.</h2>

<p>The three models of a secondary battery that I recently made
known to the readers of this journal have been the object of
continuous experiment. Conformably to the provisions of theory, the
zinc accumulator has shown itself practically superior to the two
others, and I have therefore chosen this type for getting up an
industrial model, which is shown in the annexed cut. The
accumulator contains four Plant&eacute; positives, having a wide
surface, and three negatives constructed of smooth sheets of lead
covered with zinc by the electrolysis of the acidulated solution of
zinc sulphate in which the couple is immersed. Accidental contact
with the interior of the pile is prevented by glass tubes fixed to
the negatives by means of leaden bands. The seven electrodes are
carried by as many distinct crosspieces of paraffined wood, which
rest upon the edges of the trough and hold the plates at a certain
distance from the bottom. These various crosspieces, which touch
one another, take the place of a cover. Each plate is provided with
a terminal. The four positive terminals are all on the same side,
and the three negatives are on the opposite side. Two brass rods
ending in a wire-clamp connect the respective terminals of the same
name. The trough consists of two oblong wooden receptacles, one
within the other, and having a play of several millimeters. This
space is lined with a tight, elastic, insulating cement having tar
for a base.</p>

<p class="ctr">REYNIER'S ZINC ACCUMULATOR. (One-fifth actual

<p>The careful insulation of the trough and all parts of the
apparatus, and the purity of the metal and its amalgamation, reduce
the local attack of the zinc to almost nothing. So the coefficient
of restitution is now comparable with that of accumulators of the
Plant&eacute; type.</p>

<p>The total electric work stored up is 130,000 kilogrammeters, or
7,600 kilogrammeters per kilogramme of accumulator. Theory
indicates that a zinc accumulator might store up as much as 15,600
kilogrammeters per kilogramme. If the present model gives half
less, it is because I have purposely exaggerated the solidity of
the trough and the mass of the electrodes.</p>

<p>It should be remarked that this capacity of 7,600 kilogrammeters
per kilogramme is much greater than that of any other accumulator
constructed in France. The new model possesses, then, despite the
size of the positives and the box, a relative lightness that will
permit it to take a place upon electric locomotives as well as in
fixed installations.</p>

<p>Independently of their use as accumulators, secondary zinc
batteries may be utilized as regulating voltameters in lighting by
incandescence, for deadening piston strokes, attenuating the
irregularities in speed, and covering accidental

<h2>THE HISTORY OF A LIGHTNING FLASH.</h2>

<h3>By W. SLINGO.</h3>

<p>Lately we have all felt, I doubt not, a considerable amount of
interest in the various phenomena attending this summer's unusually
heavy thunderstorms, accompanied, as they have been, by vivid
lightning discharges of a more or less hurtful nature. The list of
disasters published in <i>Knowledge</i>, No. 143, might be very
materially augmented were we to record such damage as has been
wrought since that list was compiled.</p>

<p>There is not, I suppose, in the mind of any intelligent man at
the present day a doubt as to the electrical origin of a lightning
flash. The questions to be considered are rather whence comes the
electricity, and in what way is the thunderstorm brought about. In
attempting to answer these questions, sight must not be lost of the
fact that the very nature of electricity is in itself almost
sufficient to baffle any effort put forth to ascertain from
lightning, as such, its whence and its whither.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, with the aid of our knowledge of static
electricity, to arrive at hypotheses of a more than chimerical
nature. In the first place, that our sphere is a more or less
electrified body is generally admitted. More than this, it is
demonstrated that the different parts of the earth's surface and
its enveloping atmosphere are variously charged. As a consequence
of these varying charges, there is a constant series of currents
flowing through the various parts of the earth, which show
themselves in such telegraph wires as may lie in the direction
followed by the currents. Such currents are known as earth
currents, and present phenomena of a highly interesting nature.
But, apart from these electrical manifestations, there is generally
a difference of electrical condition between the various parts of
the earth's surface and those portions of the atmosphere adjacent
to or above them. Inasmuch as air is one of the very best
insulators, this difference of condition (or potential) in any
particular region is in most cases incapable of being neutralized
or equilibrated by an electric flow. Consequently the air remains
more or less continually charged. With these points admitted as
facts, the question arises, Whence this electricity? There have
been very many and various opinions expressed as to the cause of
terrestrial electricity, but far the greater portion of such
theories lack fundamental probability, and indicate causes which
cannot be regarded as sufficiently extensive or operative to
produce such tremendous effects as are occasionally witnessed. I
take it that we may safely regard the evolution of electricity as
one of the ways in which force exhibits itself, that, in other
words, when work is performed electricity may result. When two
bodies are rubbed together, electricity is produced, so also is it
when two connected metals are immersed in water and one of them is
dissolved, or when one of the junctions of two metals is raised to
a higher temperature than the other junction. I will go further
than this, so far, in fact, as to maintain that there is a
reasonable ground for supposing that every movement, whether it be
of the mass or among the constituent particles, is attended by a
change of electrical distribution; and if this is true, it may
easily be conceived that inasmuch as motion is the rule of the
universe, there must be a constant series of electrical changes.
Now, these changes do not all operate in one direction, nor are
they all of similar character, whence it is that not only are there
earth currents of feeble electro-motive force, but that this E.M.F.
is constantly varying, and that, furthermore, electricity of high
E.M.F. is to be met with in various parts of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>With earth currents we have here very little to do. The rotation
of the earth is in itself sufficient to generate small currents,
and the fact that they vary in strength at regular periods of the
day and of the year enforces the suggestion that the sun exerts
considerable electrical influence on the earth. Letting it be
granted, however, that the earth is variously charged, how comes it
that the air is also charged, and with electricity of greater
tension than that of the earth itself? It was pointed out by Sir W.
Grove that if the extremities of a piece of platinum wire be placed
in a candle flame, one at the bottom and the other near the top, an
electric current will flow through the wire, indicating the
presence of electricity. If an electrified body be heated, the
electricity escapes more rapidly as the temperature rises. If a
vessel of water be electrified, and the water then converted into
steam, the electric charge will be rapidly dissipated. If a vessel
containing water be electrified, and the water allowed to escape
drop by drop, electricity will escape with each drop, and the
vessel will soon be discharged.</p>

<p>We regard it as an established fact that the earth has always a
greater or less charge; whence it is safe to assume that in the
process of evaporation which is going on all over the surface of
the globe, more particularly in equatorial regions, every particle
of water, as it rises into the air, carries with it its portion,
however minute that portion may be, of the earth's electric charge.
This small charge distributes itself over the surface of the
aqueous particle, and the vapor rises higher and higher until it
reaches that point above which the air is too rare to support it.
It then flows away laterally, and as it approaches colder regions
gets denser, sinking lower and nearer to the earth's surface. The
aqueous particles becoming reduced in size, the extent of their
surfaces is proportionately reduced. It follows that as the
particles and their surfaces are reduced, the charge is confined to
a smaller surface, and attains, therefore, a greater "surface
density," or in simpler language, a greater amount of electricity
per unit of surface.</p>

<p>Electricity, as above set forth, is in what is known as the
"static" condition (to distinguish it from electricity which is
being transferred in the form of a current), when it has the
property of "repelling itself" to the utmost limits of any
conductor upon which it may be confined. This will account for the
charge finding its way to the surface of the water particles, and
will furthermore account for the greater density of the charge as
the particle gets smaller and has the extent of its surface rapidly
diminished. It may be mentioned that the surface of a sphere varies
as the cube of its radius.</p>

<p>Returning to the discussion of the state of affairs existing
when the particles have reached their highest position in the
atmosphere, we may imagine that they set themselves off on journeys
toward either the north or the south pole. As they pass from the
hotter to the colder regions, a number of particles coalesce; these
again combine with others on the road until the vapor becomes
visible as cloud. The increased density implies increased weight,
and the cloud particles, as they sail poleward, descend toward the
surface of the earth. Assuming that a spherical form is maintained
throughout, the condensation of a number of particles implies a
considerable reduction of surface. Thus, the contents of two
spheres vary as the cubes of their radii, or eight (the cube of 2)
drops on combining will form a drop twice the radius of one of the
original drops. We may safely conceive hundreds and thousands of
such combinations to take place until a cloud mass is formed, in
which the constituent parts are more or less in contact, and,
therefore, behave electrically as a single conductor of irregular
surface, upon which is accumulated all the electricity that was
previously distributed over the surfaces of the millions of
particles that now compose it.</p>

<p>The tendency of an electric charge upon the surface of a
conductor is to take upon itself a position in which it may
approach nearest to an equal and opposite charge; or, if possible,
to attain neutrality. If, then, a cloud has a charge, and there is
no other cloud above or near it, the charge <i>induces</i> on the
adjacent earth surface electricity of the opposite kind. Thus,
assuming the cloud to be charged with positive electricity, the
subjacent earth will be in the negative state. The two
electricities<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> exert a strong tendency to
combine or to produce neutrality, whence there is a species of
stress applied to the intervening air. Possibly the cloud will be
drawn bodily toward the earth more or less rapidly, according as
the charge is great or small. Or, on the other hand, the cloud may
roll on for leagues, carrying its influence with it, so that the
various portions of the earth underneath become successively
charged and discharged as the cloud progresses on its journey.</p>

<p>Should the cloud be near the earth, or should it be very highly
charged, the tension of the two electricities may be so great as to
overcome the resistance of the intervening air; and if this
resistance should prove too weak, what happens? How does the
discharge show itself? It takes place in the form of a lightning
flash, and passing from the one surface to the other&mdash;or,
maybe, simultaneously from both&mdash;produces neutrality more or
less complete.</p>

<p>There has recently been a little discussion in these pages on
the subject of lightning, some having stated that they discerned
the discharge to take place upward&mdash;that is, from the earth
toward the cloud. I will not venture so far as to say whether or
not the direction of the discharge is discernible; possibly the
flash may sometimes be long enough to enable one to tell; but I
have never so seen it, and have always looked upon the eye as a
deceitful member&mdash;very. "The lightning flash itself never
lasts more than 1/100000 of a second." It is, however, just as
likely that a discharge may travel upward as downward. What
controls the discharge? Does the quality of the charge?&mdash;that
is to say, is the positive or the negative more prone to break
disruptively through the insulating medium? Investigations with
Geissler's and other tubes containing highly rarefied gases have
made it tolerably clear that there is a greater "tearing away"
influence at the negative than at the positive pole, and if two
equal balls, containing one a positive and the other a negative
charge, be equally heated, the negative is more readily dissipated
than the positive. But, so far as we at present know, this question
enters into the discussion scarcely, if at all. Our knowledge seems
rather to point to the substances upon which the charges are
collected. The self-repellent nature of electricity compels it to
manifest itself at the more prominent parts of the surface, the
level being forsaken for the point. The tension of the charge, or
its tendency to fly off, is proportionately increased. And if at a
given moment the tension attains a certain intensity, the discharge
follows, emanating from the surface which offers the greatest
facilities for escape. The earth is generally flatter than the
cloud, whence, in all probability, the discharge more frequently
originates with the cloud.</p>

<p>Should a lightning flash strike the earth and produce direct
neutrality, it is possible that no damage will result, although
this again is not always certain, because when the cloud charge
acts inductively on the earth it produces the opposite (say
negative) charge on the nearer parts, the similar (or positive)
state is also produced at some place more or less distant.
Sometimes this "freed" positive (which, by the way, accumulates
gradually and physiologically imperceptibly) is collected at some
portion of the earth's surface. When the negative is neutralized by
the discharge, the freed positive is no longer confined to a
particular region, but tends to dissipate itself, and a shock may
be felt more or less severely by any person within the region. Or,
again, a similar shock may be experienced by a person standing
within the negative zone on the neutralization of the charge.</p>

<p>I may take the opportunity here to mention a highly interesting
and instructive incident observed on local telegraph circuits
during a thunderstorm. The storm may be taking place at some
distance from the point of observation. The electrified cloud
induces the opposite charge beneath it, the similar charge being
repelled. It is noticeable that the needle of a galvanometer,
starting from the middle position, goes gradually over to one side,
eventually indicating a considerable deflection. Suddenly, owing
apparently to a lightning discharge some distance away, the force
which caused the deflection is withdrawn, and the needle rebounds
with great violence to the opposite side. In a short time, the
cloud becoming again charged on its under surface, and recommencing
its inductive effect upon the adjacent earth, the needle starts
again, and goes through the same series of movements, a violent
counterthrow following every flash of lightning.</p>

<p>If we can so far control our imagination, we may conceive the
earth to be one large insulated conductor, susceptible to every
influence around it. If then the earth, as a mass of matter,
behaves as above indicated, there is no plausible reason for
declining to regard any other large conducting mass in a similar
light, and as a body capable of being subjected more or less
completely to the various impulses affecting the earth. In other
words, a large mass of conducting material, partially or perfectly
insulated, is, during a thunderstorm, in considerable danger. With
this portion of the subject I shall, however, deal more fully when
discussing the merits of lightning protectors.</p>

<p>Lightning discharges do not take place between cloud and earth
only, but also, and perhaps more frequently, between too oppositely
charged clouds. We then get atmospheric lightning, the flash often
extending for miles. This form of lightning is harmless, and in all
probability what we see is only a reflection of the discharge. The
oft-told tale of the lightning flying in at the window, across the
room, and out of the door, or up the chimney, is all moonshine, and
before dealing with lightning protectors I intend to expose some of
the fallacies concerning lightning. Were the discharge to pass
through a house, it would infallibly leave more decided traces and
do more damage than simply scaring a superstitious old lady now and
again. Many people are often and unnecessarily frightened during a
thunderstorm, but it may be safely predicted that a person under a
roof is infinitely safer than one who is standing alone on level
ground, and making himself a prominence inviting a discharge. Rain
almost invariably accompanies the discharge, and the roof and sides
of the house being wet, they form a more or less perfect channel of
escape should a flash strike the
building.&mdash;<i>Knowledge.</i></p>

<div class="note">We may speak of two electricities or two electric
states without necessarily implying adherence either to the single
or the double "fluid" theory. Whether electricity be of two kinds
or no, the fact remains that there are two conditions, and all the
features of this paper may be explained with equal facility by the
supporters of either hypothesis.</div>

<h2>RESEARCHES ON MAGNETISM.</h2>

<h3>By M. DUTER.</h3>

<p>If we place a thin plate of steel in a uniform magnetic field,
so that the lines of force of the field may be normal to the
surface of the plate, we have a very flat magnet, the two faces of
which are the two polar surfaces. The magnetic distribution thus
obtained seems to disappear when the plate is no longer in the
field. The following experiments show that this disappearance is
not complete. I made use of plates of tempered steel of 1
millimeter in thickness, and varying in diameter from 0.040 to
0.005 meter. With these plates I formed cylindrical batteries. In
some of these batteries the plates are directly in contact, and in
others they were separated by leaves of pasteboard, the thickness
of which varied from that of the thinnest paper to 0.001 meter. The
batteries were placed in the central portion of a very powerful
magnetic field, and after they have been taken out they formed
perfectly regular permanent magnets. The supporting power of these
magnets was the greater the nearer its constituent plates were to
each other. In a battery of 100 plates, touching each other
directly, and strongly pressed into a brass cylinder, the portative
force at each extremity rose to 30 grammes. This first result
having been obtained, I dismounted the batteries, plate by plate,
taking care to mark the upper and under side of each. I found then
that each plate retained only an excessively slight magnetism. Yet
each of them still constituted a flat magnet, of which the two
faces are the polar surfaces; for on rebuilding the battery it gave
again a perfectly regular magnet, though weaker than it was at
first. The separation of the magnet into its constituent plates,
and its reconstruction, maybe repeated
indefinitely.&mdash;<i>Comptes Rendus.</i></p>

<p>The accompanying engravings represent a light buoy made by the
Pintsch's Patent Lighting Company for the river Humber. The chief
dimensions of the buoy are given in the engraving, which also shows
that the gas holder is placed within the boat in such a way as to
be protected from blows likely to cause any leakage. The buoy has a
special form to meet its requirements as a lightship, and the
conditions of its employment is the fast tidal current of the
river. It was designed by Mr. C. Berthon, of Westminster, and is
intended to carry a six months' supply of gas, the burner,
regulator, and lamp being on the well known Pintsch system. The
hull is formed of &#8540; inch plate, 24 feet 3 inches total
length, and 9 feet beam at the line of flotation. The laps of the
plates are 4 inches wide, and riveted with &frac34; inch rivets,
spaced 2&frac14; inch apart center to center. The keel and stem are
both in one piece, as shown, and to this the garboard strake is to
be fastened. The bilge pieces are riveted on to the bilge, and made
of 9 inches by 4&frac12; inches by 9/16 inch T-iron. A wooden
fender, 4 inches by 4 inches wood, is fitted on both sides of hull,
running from stern to stern, by 3 inches by 3&frac12; inches by
7/16 inch L-iron top and bottom with the sheer as shown. The hull
from water line falls in as shown, so as to describe at midships an
arc of 4 feet 6 inches, and a circular deck of &#8539; inch plate
is riveted on the hull. There are two man-holes, each 16 inches
diameter in the clear, placed in end plates of the circular deck as
shown, and provided with covers &#8540; inch thick, secured by
twenty screws &frac34; inch diameter. The edge of each manhole is
stiffened by a welded iron ring. The surface of the mooring link
that comes in contact with the shackle and mooring chain is
steeled. The gas holder rests upon a plate bent up on each side,
and riveted to the keelson, and is prevented from rolling by four
gusset plates, with two short pieces of angle iron riveted thereto
at the ends and coming in contact with the holder, and at the ends
by angular plates, and angle iron riveted on each side and riveted
to the keelson. The superstructure consists of four legs of angle
iron 2&frac12; inches by 2&frac12; inches by 5/16 inch, the upper
ends of the legs being attached to a square flanged plate for
supporting the lighting apparatus. Four wooden battens of pitch
pine, 4 inches by 1&frac12; inches, and bolted on to each cant of
the angle iron superstructure, with &#8542; inch galvanized iron
bolts and nuts.</p>

<h2>PROJECT FOR A ROADSTEAD AT HAVRE.</h2>

<p>The present port of Havre is absolutely insufficient to answer
the ever increasing requirements of commerce. Its entrance, which
is too narrow and not deep enough, does not permit steamers to go
in, come out, and perform their evolutions with the rapidity
required by our epoch. So they are gradually abandoning our port,
and going to load and unload at Anvers and elsewhere. A large
number of wise heads, who are anxious about the future of this port
and our national interests, have devoted themselves to finding a
means of enlarging it, not by dredging <i>new</i> basins, which
would prove ruinous to the budget and useless in twenty years, but
by installing a true roadstead at the entrance to the present
basins.</p>

<p class="ctr">FIG 1.&mdash;PLAN OF THE PROJECTED ROADSTEAD AT
HAVRE.</p>

<p>Upon the maps of the hydrographic service may be seen, under the
name of the Little Roadstead, a vast extent of sea nearly two
kilometers wide by three to four in length, bounded upon one side
by the heights of Heve and St. Adresse, and upon the other by the
rocky line of Eclat and of the heights of the roadstead (Fig. 1).
This Little Roadstead, so called, in order to become a genuine one,
would have to be protected against the great waves of the open sea.
To thus protect it, to close it as quickly and as cheaply as
possible&mdash;that is the problem.</p>

<p>In 1838, Charles de Massas presented a project (the first in
order of date), which consisted in constructing upon the Eclat reef
a semi-lunate dike, and a breakwater at Cape Heve. Moreover, upon
the emergent parts of the Eclat reef and heights of the roadstead
he proposed to erect two forts.</p>

" FIG. 2.&mdash;LEWIS' FLOATING BREAKWATER."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 2.&mdash;LEWIS' FLOATING BREAKWATER.</p>

<p>The defense of the port of Havre is a very important question,
and one that appears to be completely abandoned. Since Engineer
Degaulle in 1808 advised the erection of a fort upon the Eclat, and
requests have periodically been made and projects drawn. The
requests are forgotten, but the drawings are in the Ministers'
portfolios, and if France should to-morrow have a war with a
maritime power our great northern port might be destroyed and
burned by the smallest squadron.</p>

<p>Some years after Massas' project, two officers, Deloffre and
Bleve, and an engineer named Renaud, received a commission to
search for a means of closing a portion of Seine Bay. These
gentlemen advised the erection of two dikes, one on the Eclat shoal
in the very axis of this reef, and the other at Heve. Between these
two masonry dikes was to be placed a floating breakwater. This
project, which was submitted to Admiral de Hell in 1845, had a
favorable reception, and the Admiral especially applauded the trial
of breakwaters, "which were much talked of in England, although the
effects that they might produce were not well known." Deloffre,
Bleve, and Renauds' project comprised two forts&mdash;one to the
north and the other to the south of the roadstead. For a long time
nothing more was said about it, and it is only during recent years,
when the peril has become imminent for Havre (threatened as it is
of being abandoned even by the French transatlantics), that the
question has again became the order of the day.</p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 3.&mdash;FROIDEVILLE'S FLOATING
BREAKWATER.&mdash;END VIEW.</p>

<p>Mr. Bert, a merchant, would protect the Little Roadstead by
means of two jetties, 1,000 and 1,600 meters in length, built, one
of them upon the Eclat and the other upon the eminences of the
roadstead. These would be constructed by forming a foundation of
loose rocks, and using earth and brick above the level of the
water. Mr. Vial has likewise proposed a rockwork of 2,000 meters in
length, to form a dike 10 meters in height and width, whose
platform would be on a level with the highest tides.</p>

<p>Next comes the more recent project of Mr. Coulon. Seeing that it
is the deposits of the ocean and not those of the Seine that
accumulate upon the estuary, Mr. Coulon advises the construction of
a dike about 2,000 meters in length, starting from the Havre jetty,
and ending at the southwest extremity of the shoals at the
roadstead heights, and a second one returning toward the northwest,
of from 500 to 1,000 meters. A third and very long one of not less
than 8 kilometers would be built from Honfleur to the Ratier
shoals.</p>

<p>This latter one, in contracting the bay, would contribute to
increase the force of the current, which, throwing back at the
ocean its mud and pebbles, would give us the depths of 15 and 20
meters indicated on the map of Beautemps-Beaupre.</p>

<p>This year, again, two projects have arisen; one of them due to
Mr. Thuillard-Froideville, and the other to Mr. Hersent.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Hersent, it would be necessary to surround the
Little Roadstead with an insubmersible dike built upon the rocky
shoals, which would begin at Cape Heve (which it would consolidate)
and end opposite the entrance to the port at 1,600 meters from the
jetties. Through it there would be five passages. Afterward another
dike would be constructed, starting from the shore and running to
meet the jetty designed to inclose the Little Roadstead. On turning
the angle at which it met the jetty it would be continued as far as
to Berville. Finally, a third dike, running from Honfleur to
Berville, would complete the system.</p>

<p>Mr. Hersent's project, which is one of the most remarkable of
those that have been proposed, has one fault, and that is that it
would require twelve years of work, and cost 158 million
francs.</p>

<p>Mr. Thuillard-Froideville, completely renouncing masonry dikes
as being too costly and taking too long to construct, proposes to
inclose the Havre roadstead by means of floating breakwaters. As we
have already seen, the use of these between Cape Heve and the Eclat
shoals had already been proposed in 1845. As the project was
abandoned, the models of these breakwaters are rare.</p>

<p>In Bouniceau's "Marine Constructions" we find a curious figure,
a sort of open framework of clumsy form anchored in a singular
manner, and surmounted by rooms for watchmen, semaphores, posts for
the shipwrecked, etc. It is, indeed, the most complicated and most
impracticable type that could be imagined.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis' model, which was exhibited last year at the
International Fisheries Exhibition, was, on the contrary, one of
the simplest. It consisted of a strong piece of wood of nearly
triangular section, the sharpest angle of which, being turned
oceanward, was designed to cut the waves and cause them to break
over it (Fig. 2). If, by favor of divine Providence, this
breakwater, which presents absolutely plane surfaces to the shock
and pressure of the waves, is not broken to fragments in the first
tempest, it will certainly acquit itself of the <i>role</i> for
which the inventor destined it. When we have a system of resistance
to the sea, anchored and facing a certain direction, and
consequently not being able to revolve around its axis as vessels
do, care must be taken not to give it entire surfaces.</p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 4.&mdash;FROIDEVILLE'S BREAKWATER.&mdash;MODE
OF JOINING THE PARTS.</p>

<p>Mr. Froideville's breakwater consists of a framework 25 meters
in length, and 9 in height and width, and having the form of an
irregular 5-sided prism (Fig. 3). The smallest side of the prism is
designed to serve as a flat keel. The axis is formed of a metallic
float, from whence start radii that form the skeleton of the
framework, and that are designed for connecting the center with
five long spruce beams that form the angles of the prism. To these
beams are affixed the cross pieces that form the openwork sides.
Five long pieces of wood parallel with the beams, but not so strong
as they, protect the cross pieces and secure them against breakage
in the middle. All the angles of the breakwater and all points of
juncture of the pieces are protected with iron, and it is in order
to counterbalance the weight of all this iron that the central
float is used. Parallel with this first breakwater, there are two
other and smaller ones, which are designed for reducing the effect
of rolling as much as possible. Reduced to a single float, the
breakwater might remain under the waves too long, but, owing to the
two others, it rights itself, warps around, and always presents the
spur of its sharp roof to the wave.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the breakwaters from clashing against each
other, they are united end to end in a very simple and ingenious
manner. From each of them there starts a deeply inserted iron bar
which terminates in a journal that permits the breakwater to
oscillate. Between these two bars there is a sort of swivel, whose
pieces, in playing upon one another, give the breakwaters
elasticity, while always holding them apart (Fig. 4). From each
side of the swivel start the branches of a stirrup iron to which
the anchorage chain is attached. This latter is of steel, without
solderings, and it is so perfectly constructed that no breakage
need be feared. To the other extremity of the chain is attached an
anchor having two flukes, which both engage with the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. Froideville proposes to set up two lines of these
breakwaters, for a length of about 7&frac12; kilometers, starting
at the north from Cape Heve, taking in depths of 15 meters (the
best that are found in the Little Roadstead), passing in front of
the Eclat shoal and the heights, and ending opposite the entrance
of the present port.</p>

<p>The first row is designed for breaking the force of the waves,
and the second for lending its aid in times of high tempests, and
stopping the surge that has escaped from the first.</p>

<p>The extreme simplicity of this project has permitted its
promoter to affirm that in a few months, and with nine millions, he
can inclose the Havre roadstead.</p>

<p>The Little Roadstead, being thenceforward protected, will become
an excellent port of refuge in bad weather. In addition, a system
of lighters, or, better, a few floats connected with the shore and
forming a rock, will permit vessels to take on their cargoes with
great rapidity.</p>

<p>Mr. Froideville's project presents the further advantage of
rendering it easier to put the port of Havre quickly in defense. A
certain number of floating batteries, anchored behind the
breakwaters and protecting the advances of torpedo boats by means
of their firing, would make a formidable defense. Not having to
perform any evolutions, they might without danger be invested with
armor plate thicker than that of ordinary ironclads. In order to
complete the system, there might be erected upon the Eclat shoal an
ironclad fort like that which defends the entrance of
Portsmouth.</p>

<p>An English chronicler of the fourteenth century, in speaking of
his country, places it above all others, and declares that men are
handsomer, whiter, and purer blooded there than elsewhere, and he
says that this is so "because it is so." We would not like to
imitate his naive reasoning, and yet, for defending the very
original system proposed by Mr. Froideville, we have only our
conviction, which we share, moreover, with a large number of
sea-faring men and engineers. Mathematics are powerless to predict
to us with accuracy the manner in which the floating breakwaters
will behave, but experiment remains. Let the promoter of the
project, then, be given authority to inclose a few hundred meters,
and if, as we suppose, the breakwaters shall remain immovable in a
northwester, a maritime revolution will have been brought
about.&mdash;<i>La Nature.</i></p>

<h2>IMPROVED CATCH BASIN.</h2>

<p>In 1882, M. Bacle published in <i>Le G&eacute;nie Civil</i> a
study of the sewer systems in some of the large foreign cities.
There may be found there a description of the Liernur system at
Amsterdam, Leyden, and Dordrecht, in Holland, and in certain cities
of Germany and the United States.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/9e.png"><img src=
"./images/9e_th.jpg" alt=" IMPROVED CATCH BASIN."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">IMPROVED CATCH BASIN.</p>

<p>This system consists in the employment of two distinct systems
of ducts, one for the discharges from water-closets and the other
for household wastes, rain water, and the discharges from factories
when sufficiently purified. This arrangement allows the employment
of sewers of small section, provided that it shall be unnecessary
to enter them for the purpose of cleansing them. It has been
necessary, therefore, to provide inlets with a separating apparatus
called "gully" or "catch basin," which retains as completely as
possible all solid matter, mud, excrement, and <i>debris</i> of
every kind which maybe floated in by street washing or by
rain-water, and which may be capable of causing stoppages in the
sewers, the choking up being followed by fermentation and the
emanation of noxious vapors.</p>

<p>M.C. Pieper of Berlin suggests a device for a catch basin, which
appears to meet the requirements. It is in the form of a
cylindrical metal box, enlarged in its upper section to receive a
filtering cylinder of perforated sheet iron, which occupies almost
the upper half of the device and rests upon the smaller lower part.
The entire apparatus is covered by a movable funnel, through which
enter water and any rubbish which it may carry with it. From one
side a tube allows the liquid to be discharged, while a siphon
placed on the opposite side serves the same purpose under certain
circumstances, as will be explained.</p>

<p>Figure 1 represents the apparatus discharging under normal
conditions. The heavy matter, sand, stones, etc., falls to the
bottom into a receptacle which can be lifted out from time to time
and emptied. The lighter buoyant matters, straw, vegetable
<i>debris</i>, paper, etc., remain at the surface, and are retained
by the filter; the water passing through the holes in the sheet
iron rushes in a filtered condition through the annular space which
exists in the upper part between the two cylinders, and escapes by
the waste-pipe when the water reaches a proper level. If at a given
moment the quantity of water flowing in is too much to be
discharged through this waste-pipe, the level of the water mounts
in the cylinder until it reaches the top of the siphon. Immediately
the siphon comes into play and empties the upper part of the
apparatus, and the filtered water contained in the annular space
already mentioned quickly re-enters the cylinder through the
perforated sheet iron, and in so doing cleans out the perforations
with considerable energy. This second period is represented in the
second figure.</p>

<p>The mouth of the siphon being placed above the movable basket,
the heavy matters contained in the latter are not in the least
disturbed, and the metallic screen placed over the mouth prevents
the entrance of any floating matters. When siphonic action ceases,
the water in the short arm of the siphon empties itself into the
main receptacle, and by so doing cleanses the screen. During a rain
or the washing of the streets, the siphon can work in concurrence
with the ordinary discharge-pipe. It is evident of course that
these two&mdash;pipes can be placed on the same side of the
apparatus, if this prove the most convenient arrangement.</p>

<p>We will add that this apparatus can be applied not only to the
Liernur system, but also can be used for preventing the entrance of
obstructions into sewers of the ordinary type, where the grade is
small or where the quantity of water is insufficient; and if we
adopt the system of "everything to the sewer," can we not find in
the employment of this apparatus an element for the realization of
the famous formula, "Always in circulation, and never in
stagnation?"&mdash;<i>Le G&eacute;nie Civil.</i></p>

<h2>WATER-POWER WITH HIGH PRESSURES AND WROUGHT-IRON
WATER-PIPE.</h2>

<h3>By HAMILTON SMITH, JR., M. Am. Soc. C.E.</h3>

<h3>METHODS OF CONDUCTING WATER AND TRANSMITTING POWER.</h3>

<p>A description of the mode of using water-power for driving the
North Bloomfield tunnel in California, some years since, will give
a good illustration of some of the advantages of the hurdy-gurdy.
This tunnel was originally about 8,000 feet long, through a slate
highly metamorphosed, with its general line passing under a
good-sized stream, at a depth of about 190 feet. There were eight
working-shafts, each about 200 feet deep, which, with the lower
entrance or portal, gave sixteen working faces. Diamond drills were
used at the lower heading requiring power; the other fifteen
headings were driven by hand-work. It was uncertain how much water
would be encountered; but from the location, it was evident that a
large quantity might be struck in any shaft, and hence it became
necessary to have ample power at hand at each opening, in readiness
for such an emergency. A pipe main was laid along the general line
of the tunnel, with its pen-stock 285 feet vertical above the
surface at the upper shaft, and 549 feet above the lowest shaft. It
was made of single riveted sheet-iron, of No. 14 (Birmingham)
gauge, in lengths of 20 feet, put together stove-pipe fashion, with
the joints made tight by cloth tarred strips and pine wedges. This
pipe had a diameter of 15 inches at the pen-stock, diminishing from
this to 13, 11, and 7 inches at its lower end. From it, short
branches, 7 inches in diameter, were extended to the several
shafts. It was in one place carried across the stream by a light
suspension bridge, some 150 feet long, the trunk of a tree on each
side forming a convenient tower. The aggregate length of the main
and branches was 9,960 feet, with some 2,500 feet additional, for
the branch to the diamond drills. The pipe was laid on the surface
of the ground, its only protection being in places a couple of
1&frac12;-inch planks tacked together, and placed over it; the
range of temperature was from 10 degrees to 107 degrees Fahr. (in
the shade). It was inspected by the foreman of the tunnel-work as
he daily walked over the line; besides the occasional driving of a
few wedges and putting on a band or two, it gave no trouble from
leakage, which probably for its entire length did not amount to
more than an average of 3 or 4 cubic feet a minute; from time to
time, a little sawdust was put into the pen-stock. Three stop-gates
were placed on the main, and a separate stop-gate at each shaft,
operated by a fine-threaded screw, so that the water could be cut
off when desired.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/10a.png"><img src=
"./images/10a_th.jpg" alt=" FIG. 13."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 13.</p>

<p>Fig. 13 shows the arrangement of the machinery for hoisting and
pumping, which was identical at the several shafts, except that the
hurdy-gurdies varied from 16&frac12; feet in diameter at the upper
shaft to 21 feet at the lowest shaft. The water-wheel moved only in
one direction; the pinion on the wheel-shaft drove the spur-wheel,
to which the pitman of the pump-bob was attached. On the spur-wheel
shaft was a friction-gear, driving the hoisting-reel; this reel was
mounted on sliding blocks, so that hoisting was done by putting it
in gear, the empty load being dropped by a friction-band. Changing
the size of the water-wheel as the pressure increased permitted the
use of the same pattern of machinery at the different shafts. The
water was brought to the wheel by a discharge-pipe, some nine feet
long, having a vertical movement by ball-and-socket joint, so that
at pleasure, by dropping the pipe, the machinery could be run at
various speeds, or entirely stopped. At the end of this
discharge-pipe was a cast tapered nozzle, about 3&frac12; inches in
diameter, in which was inserted a ring of saw-plate steel having
the desired diameter, and which was held in place by an annular
screw-cap. By changing the ring, which only required a few moments'
time, any desired amount of water, up to 3 or 4 cubic feet a
second, could be discharged against the wheel. The stop-gate was
left wide open while the machinery was running. The pumping was
done by eighteen pumps, of Cornish pattern; the largest amount of
water pumped from any one shaft was something over 30 cubic feet a
minute; the power at hand, however, was ample to pump more than
twice that quantity. It was rather curious at, this shaft to see
more water coming from the pumps than was used on the wheel. The
two diamond drills were driven by a small hurdy-gurdy set on the
rear of the drill carriage. This, but at another tunnel, was
afterward modified by placing a separate hurdy-gurdy on a sleeve on
each drill-rod; the advance movement of the drill being given by
hydrostatic pressure on an annular piston, thus doing away with all
gearing. These eight sets of machinery were run for nearly
2&frac12; years' time; the only break being that of a spur-wheel,
doubtless caused by the careless dropping of a steel bar between it
and its pinion. Aside from this accident, practically not a dollar
was spent for repairs, and the machinery, including the pipe, was
in about as good order when the tunnel was finished as when it was
first erected. One man, on a twelve hour shift, operated the
machinery at each shaft, besides dumping the cars; two men kept the
18 pumps on the line in order, the principal work being in keeping
the suction-pipes for the down-grade headings tight; thus a force
of 18 men was only required for the eight shafts. The cost of the
pipe, gates, etc., when put in place, was $14,631, and of the
machinery about $60,000.</p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 14.</p>

<p>At the Idaho gold quartz mine, situated near Grass Valley,
California, water-power has been introduced during the past year
(1883), taking the place of steam. The supply main is of
wrought-iron, 22 inches in diameter, 8,764 feet long, buried in the
ground below frost-line. The joints, as a rule, are riveted
together, with occasional lead joints to admit of slight movements
in the pipe.<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The pipe was coated by placing
each joint in a bath of boiling tar and asphaltum; to insure the
most thorough coating, it is necessary to keep the pipe for ten or
fifteen minutes in the boiling mixture. A cast-iron stop-gate is
placed at the lower end of the main, and also one at each of the
branches. Cast-iron man-holes are attached to the main, which,
although they have given no trouble in this particular case, are
very objectionable for high pressures, as it is difficult to avoid
ruptures with cast and wrought-iron combined, owing to the great
difference in the elasticity of the two metals. The long seams of
this pipe are double-riveted, and the round seams single riveted;
at the lower end, iron of No. 6 gauge is used. From the end of the
main, the water is led to the several wheels by branches of smaller
diameter.</p>

<p>The water is delivered at the hoisting-wheel with a total head
of 542.6 feet. For power and for mill uses, etc., the required
supply is about 8 cubic feet a second; this draught reduces the
effective head to say 523 feet.</p>

<p>The work done consists in driving the following described
machinery:</p>

<p>A large air-compressor&mdash;2 cylinders, double acting, air
compressed to 75 pounds&mdash;requiring about 140 horse-power.</p>

<p>A line of Cornish pumps, forcing the water from a depth of 1,450
feet vertical; 12-inch plungers for upper 800 feet, 6-inch plungers
for lower 650 feet, with 6-foot stroke, requiring from 55 to 70
horse-power.</p>

<p>Hoisting from a double-compartment shaft&mdash;two connected
winding reels, moving separate cages&mdash;requiring 35
horse-power, or more.</p>

<p>A few small machine-tools and smithy forges, requiring 3 or 4
horse-power.</p>

<p>A 35-stamp mill, with concentrating apparatus, etc., requiring
about 70 horse-power.</p>

<p>The total amount of power required being say 320 horse-power,
for which seven Pelton hurdy-gurdy wheels are employed.</p>

<p>The power in all cases is transmitted by systems of Manila rope
belting; the rope is 2 inches in diameter; the grooves in the
sheaves or pulleys are slightly oval, so that the rope does not go
quite to the bottom; the ropes are horizontal, and run very slack
(no tighteners), with no appreciable slip; the splices are made
very long, to obtain uniformity in diameter.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/10c.png"><img src=
"./images/10c_th.jpg" alt=" FIG. 15."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 15.</p>

<p>This method of transmitting power appears to work most perfectly
and has given excellent satisfaction. It is thought, at the Idaho,
to be greatly preferable to the gearing formerly in use when the
works were driven by steam (for such work as pumping or hoisting,
leather or rubber belting is never used), besides being much
cheaper in first cost.</p>

<p>The wheel driving the air-compressor is 6 feet in diameter,
running 300 turns<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> per minute, with 1-15/18-inch
nozzle; three ropes are used from the wheel shaft to the
counter-shaft, and six ropes from the latter to the fly-wheel
shaft.</p>

<p>For driving the pumps, there are two water-wheels, set on the
same shaft, one 5 feet and the other 7 feet in diameter, either of
which can be used at will, thus permitting different rates of
speed; two nozzles are placed on each wheel, so that if necessary
the power can at any time be doubled. The smaller wheel has a
1&frac14; inch nozzle, and runs 360 turns a minute; the larger has
1&#8539;-inch nozzle, and makes 270 turns a minute. There are two
ropes from the wheel-shaft to a counter-shaft, and four ropes to
the fly-wheel shaft, on which is the pinion driving the spur-wheel
attached to the pitman of the pump-bob. Hoisting is done by two
wheels placed side by side on the same shaft, the buckets and
nozzle of each wheel being placed in opposite directions. Both
wheels are 8 feet in diameter, with 15/16-inch nozzles, and make at
full speed about 225 turns a minute. Reversing the movement of the
shaft is done by shutting off water from one wheel, and turning
water on the other wheel; the two water-gates for these nozzles are
quickly opened or closed by hydrostatic pressure, afforded from the
water main. In addition to the usual brakes on the winding-reels, a
brake is placed on the wheel-shaft, so that it can be stopped in a
very short period of time.</p>

<p>The shock to the pipe by the almost instantaneous cutting off
the water at these hoisting-wheels (nearly one cubic foot per
second) has not apparently had any injurious, effect. To lessen
this shock, a compensating balance was designed, but which is not
now in use. A wheel, of small diameter, is used for the smithy,
etc., running at a very high velocity. The wheel driving the
stamp-mill is 6 feet in diameter, makes 300 revolutions a minute,
and is supplied through a 1-3/16 inch nozzle. The head of water at
this point is a few feet greater than at the other wheels. Power is
transmitted from the hoisting and mill-wheel shafts by two and four
ropes, the same as with the pumping rig. The amount of work done,
or of water used, has not been carefully determined; judging from
the indicator cards taken from the old steam-engines, the managers
of the Idaho believe that an efficiency of fully 80 per cent. of
the theoretic power of the water is obtained on the main
driving-shafts of the machinery. The substitution of water for
steam-power has resulted in a large saving of expense. Although the
hills near by are covered with fine forests, thus making wood
cheap, and although a round price is charged for water by the
company furnishing it, the cost of the water is considerably less
than that of the wood formerly used as fuel. The cost of attendance
is altogether in favor of the water-wheels, which hardly require
any attention. The cost of the change from steam to water-power was
$46,496.32.</p>

<h2>TEXAS CREEK PIPE AND AQUEDUCT.</h2>

<p>A description of this work will be of interest in showing the
general practice followed in California for carrying water across
deep mountain gorges. In order to augment its water supply, the
North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Company desired to conduct water
from a stream known as Texas Creek, in Nevada County, California,
across the Big Ca&ntilde;on branch of the South Yuba River into the
main Bloomfield flume or aqueduct, which was located on the side of
Big Ca&ntilde;on Creek, at a vertical elevation of 620 feet above
the bed of the latter stream. The quantity of water to be carried
was about 32 cubic feet a second (1,250 miner's inches), which
could be diverted from Texas Creek at a point 480 feet vertical
above the Bloomfield flume. An aqueduct about 4,000 feet long,
partly of ditch and partly of flume, was needed to bring the water
from the catchment dam on the creek to the brow of the gorge. The
vertical head for the pipe could therefore be from a maximum of 460
feet down to any lesser head; with a head of 460 feet, the pipe
would be 4,790 feet long; and with a head of 220 feet, the length
would be 4,290 feet. Assuming a maximum tensile strain upon the
iron of 16,500 pounds per square inch, with the formula for the
greatest head of about</p>

<p><img src="./images/tex11.png" align="middle" alt=
"d = \Big(.359 \frac{l}{h}\Big)^{\frac{1}{5}},\ [\text{or,}\ v = 68 \Big(\frac{dh}{l}\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}},\ \text{and}\ Q = 32],">
</p>

<p>and a lower value of the coefficient in the last equation for
the lesser heads, it was found, by calculation, that the least cost
could be obtained with a head from 300 to 350 feet. The head fixed
upon was 303.6 feet, with a length of 4,438.7 feet. A profile of
the pipe, with nearly the same horizontal and vertical scales
(horizontal scale, showing slope lengths), is given in Fig. 14;
details are given in Figs. 15 and 16. The pipe was of double
riveted sheet iron, made in lengths of about 20 feet, and of the
following thicknesses:</p>

<p>Some of the iron was of the very poorest quality; the pipe was
made by contract in San Francisco, without the supervision of an
inspector, as the contractors were a firm of good reputation; the
bad quality of the iron was not detected until too late to have it
corrected. Since then, the writer has always had such
pipes&mdash;the mines of which he has been the manager using large
quantities&mdash;made directly on the ground where they are to be
used; the pipe makers, in the latter case, always reject such
sheets as are too much below in thickness the standard gauge, and
those which show in passing through the rolls the bad quality of
iron; tests of each joint by hydrostatic pressure would add too
much to the cost.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/11a.png"><img src=
"./images/11a_th.jpg" alt=" FIG. 16."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 16.</p>

<p>The maximum tensile strain upon each of the seven thicknesses of
iron used was intended to be 16,500 pounds per square inch. Some of
the sheets were below the standard gauge, so that, in reality, the
tensile strain is sometimes as high as 18,000 pounds. The mean
diameter of the pipe was 1.416 feet. The entrance into the
pen-stock was tapered, so that the coefficient of contraction was
about 0.92. For pressures not exceeding say 380 feet, the joints
were put together stove-pipe fashion. For greater pressures, the
joints were made by an inner sleeve riveted on one end of the
joint, with an outer lap-welded band, as shown by Fig. 15; lead was
run into the space between the outer band and the pipe, and then
tightly driven up by calking-irons. The pipe was laid under the bed
of the Big Ca&ntilde;on Creek, a large stream when in freshet,
where the head below the hydraulic grade line was 760 feet. Some of
the lead joints leaked slightly at first, but this was soon
remedied by more careful calking. No man-holes or escape-gates were
used. The pipe for the larger part of the year is not filled at its
upper end; when such is the case, the water at the inlet carries
down the pipe a great quantity of air, for which escapes must be
provided to prevent a jarring or throbbing, which would soon
destroy the pipe. The escape air-valves used are shown by Fig. 16.
They consist simply of a heavy flap valve of cast-iron, with recess
for lead filling to give greater weight set on top the pipe,
seating on a vulcanized rubber cushion, and swinging on a loose
hinge. When the pipe is only partly filled with water, the valves
drop down by their own weight, allowing the air to freely escape;
when the water rises above the level of a valve, it is tightly
closed by the resulting pressure. There are fourteen of these
valves, those on the lower end being designed to allow air to
freely enter the pipe in case it should burst in the deeper
portion, and thus prevent any collapse from atmospheric pressure.
The valves have answered the desired purposes most effectually. The
pipe was hauled over a road built to the inlet end, and shot down
the mountain side by means of a V-shaped trough of wood. For the
lower end, the joints were hauled up the cliff side into place by a
crab worked by horse-power. On steep inclinations, the pipe was
held firmly in place by wire ropes fastened to iron pins in the
solid rock, as shown by the sketch. The covering of earth and stone
was 1 foot to 2 feet in depth; with steep slopes, the earth was
kept from sliding by rough dry walls, or by cedar plank placed
crosswise. The pipe was laid in 1878; the first year it broke
twice, owing to the wretched quality of the iron; since then, it
has given no trouble, and has required practically no attention.
The cost of this work&mdash;ditch and flume 4,000 feet, and pipe
4,440 feet&mdash;was $23,779.53.</p>

<p>A comparison of the relative values of n, in the formula v = n
(r s)<sup>&frac12;</sup>, for the foregoing ditch, flume, and pipe
will be instructive. The ditch has a width on the bottom of 3 feet,
on the top of 6 feet, with a depth of 3 feet, and an inclination of
20 feet per mile; its sides are rough, being cut in part through
the rock and with sharp curves, although fairly regular; with a
flow of about 1,300 miner's inches (32.8 cubic feet per second) the
ditch runs about full.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p><img src="./images/tex1.png" align="middle" alt=

<p>and</p>

<p><img src="./images/tex5.png" align="middle" alt=
"n\ (\text{in}\ v = n (r s)^\frac{1}{2}) = 33."></p>

<p>The flume is of unplaned boards, rectangular, 2.67 wide X 2.83
deep, with an inclination of 32 feet per mile. There are sharp
curves, although these were made as regular as practicable; the
boiling action of the water passing around these curves brought the
flow line (Q = 32.8) nearly up to the top of the sides; with a
straight flume of the same size, the water would have doubtless
stood several inches lower.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p>a = 2.67 &times; 2.83 = 7.56 ;</p>

<p><img src="./images/tex6.png" align="middle" alt=

<h2>PARACHUTE HYDRAULIC MOTOR.</h2>

<p>The very singular and simple hydraulic motor which we illustrate
herewith is the invention of a Russian engineer, Mr. Jagn. It is
scarcely as yet known in Western Europe, where, however, something
will probably be heard of it ere long. Its true field would seem to
be Egypt, India, or any country where canals or rivers are used for
irrigation, and where it is desired to draw water from them at
particular spots in the simplest and cheapest manner. At present in
nearly all such cases water is raised by hand or steam power;
nevertheless it must be obvious that the current of the canal
itself, slow though it may be, is quite sufficient to raise a small
portion of the discharge to the very moderate height generally
needed to lift it over the banks into the adjoining fields. Why
then is it not employed for the purpose? The answer is obvious,
when we consider the various hydraulic motors at present in use. Of
course, motors worked by water pressure must here be excluded; and
we are left with scarcely anything but the undershot wheel, the
turbine, and the screw pump. All these require expensive buildings
and erections to set them to work, present but a very small
fraction of their surface to the water at any one time, and must be
very large and costly if they are to draw even a very moderate
amount of power from such a source. There is no possibility of
adjusting them readily to suit variations in the speed of the
current or in the quantity of water required, nor of moving them
from place to place should this be convenient.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="./images/11b.png"><img src=
"./images/11b_th.jpg" alt=" PARACHUTE HYDRAULIC MOTOR."></a></p>

<p class="ctr">PARACHUTE HYDRAULIC MOTOR.</p>

<p>The motor of Mr. Jagn is on a totally different principle. Its
essential features consist, as shown, of an endless rope made of
hemp or aloe fiber, which takes a turn or two round a pair of drums
mounted on a barge or pontoon, and then passes down the channel to
return over a pulley hung from a floating punt, at such a depth
that the whole of the rope is immersed in the water. Along this
rope are suspended at equal intervals a number of parachutes made
of sail cloth. The rope passes through the center of each of these,
and to it are attached a series of strings, the other ends of which
are connected to the outside edge of the parachute. Thus they act
like the spokes of an umbrella to prevent the parachute from
opening too far under the pressure of the current. The parachutes
must be placed so far apart that the current may act fairly on
each, and the sum of the pressures forms the force which draws the
rope through the water. The moment, however, that any parachute has
passed round the return pulley, the current acts upon it in the
opposite direction. It then shuts up like an umbrella, and assumes
a volume so small that its resistance on the return journey is
insignificant. After passing round the drum at the upper end, it at
once opens afresh of its own accord, and once more becomes part of
the moving power of the whole system. The parachutes are formed by
first cutting out a complete circle of cloth, and then taking from
this a sector equal to one-fifth or one-sixth of the total area.
Such parachutes are found to keep their form when stretched by the
water better than a surface originally spherical, although the
latter would be theoretically more correct. The motion of the drum
is transmitted by spur, gear, or otherwise as may be required, to
give the requisite speed.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the advantages of the system are as
follows: First, the facility it offers for obtaining a large
working area, which may be increased or diminished at will,
according to the requirements of the moment, by lengthening or
shortening the rope. Secondly, the ease with which it is erected
and set to work. Thirdly, the small part of the river section which
it occupies, so as to present no obstacle to navigation. Fourthly,
the ease with which it can be mounted on a barge of any kind, and
carried wherever it may be needed. Fifthly, it is not stopped, like
all other hydraulic motors, by the appearance of ice&mdash;it has,
in fact, already been worked under ice in the Neva. At the same
time, winds and waves have no influence upon it.</p>

<p>The principle of the apparatus is not altogether new. In 1872
there was tried on the Ohio River an arrangement termed the Brooks
motor. It was composed of two drums, placed horizontally and
parallel to each other. Round these there passed endless chains at
equal spaces apart on the length of the drums, and to these chains
were fixed wooden blades or arms of a curved form, and so jointed
to the frames that they opened when moving in one direction, and
closed down on the chain when moving in the other. In this machine
the weight of the chains was a serious obstacle to obtaining any
large amount of power. The whole apparatus was mounted on a heavy
wooden scaffold, which proved an impediment to the flow of the
river. Again, the resistance due to the surface of the returning
blades and to their stiffness was found to be far from
insignificant.</p>

<p>In the present system Mr. Jagn has found, after many
experiments, that the best effect was obtained when the parachutes
were spaced apart at twice their diameter, and when the rope made
an angle of 8 degrees to 10 degrees with the current. It is found
that when open and in motion the parachutes never touch the bottom.
This was the case with a rope containing 180 parachutes of 4 feet
diameter, and working in a depth of only 6 feet. This is easily
explained by the fact that the velocity of a current always
diminishes as it approaches the bottom. Hence the pressure on the
lower part of the parachute will be less than that on the upper
part; but the former pressure tends to draw the parachute downward,
while the latter tends to raise it to the top of the water. Thus,
the latter being the larger, the parachute will always have a
tendency to rise. In fact, it is necessary to sink the return
pulley sufficiently deep to make sure that the parachutes will not
emerge from the surface. For the same reason no intermediate
supports are needed over the driving span; if any are needed it is
for the return span, on which the parachutes are closed. Of course,
if metal were used instead of hemp, the case would be entirely
different, and intermediate supports would have to be used for
anything but very moderate lengths.</p>

<p>In practice, Mr. Jagn has employed two ropes wound upon the same
pair of drums, which are mounted upon a pontoon. The ropes are
spread out from each other, as in Fig. 1, making an angle of about
10 degrees. The low specific gravity of the system enables ropes to
be employed of as great a length as 450 yards, each of them
carrying 350 parachutes of 17.2 square feet area. As half of these
are in action at the same time, the total working area for the two
cables is 5,860 square feet. This immense area furnishes a
considerable amount of power even in a river of feeble current.
Comparing this with a floating water wheel of the type sometimes
employed, and supposing this to have only 172 square feet of
working area, such a wheel must have a length of 46 feet, a
diameter of 23 feet, and seventy-two floats, each 2&frac12; feet
wide. The enormous dimensions thus required for a comparatively
small working area point sufficiently clearly to the advantage
which remains on the side of the parachute motor.</p>

<p>The general arrangement of the system is shown in the engraving.
Behind the return pulleys, D D, are attached cords, A A, with some
parachutes strung upon them. These present their openings to the
current and preserve the tension of the connecting ropes. At the
further end of each cord is a board, B, which is kept in a vertical
plane, but lying at a slight angle to the direction of the current;
and this acts to keep the two moving ropes apart from each other.
The two return pulleys are, however, connected by a line, E, which
can be shortened or lengthened from the pontoon, and in this way
the angle of inclination between the two ropes can be varied if
required. A grooved pulley presses upon the trailing span at the
moment before it reaches the circumference of the drum. It is
mounted on a screwed spindle, which is depressed by a nut, and thus
makes the wet rope grip the outside of the drum in a thoroughly
efficacious manner.</p>

<p>The author has made a theoretical investigation of the power
which may be developed by the system, and has worked out tables by
which, when the velocity of the current and the other elements of
the problem are known, the power developed by any given number of
parachutes can be at once determined. We do not reproduce this
investigation, which takes account of the resistance of the
returning parachutes and other circumstances, but will content
ourselves with quoting the final equation, which is as follows: T =
0.328 S V&sup3;. Here T is the work done in H.P., S is the total
working area in sq. m., and V is the velocity of the current in m.
per sec. Taking V = 1, and S = 1 sq. m., which is by no means an
impracticable quantity, we have T = 0.328 H.P. per sq. m. We may
check this result by the equation given, in English measures, by
Rankine&mdash;"Applied Mechanics," p. 398&mdash;for the pressure of
a current upon a solid body immersed in it. This equation, F = 1.8
m A v&sup2; / 2g, where m is the weight of a unit of volume of the
fluid&mdash;say 62 lb.&mdash;A is the area exposed, and v the
relative velocity of the current. Mr. Jagn finds that the maximum
of efficiency is obtained when the rope moves at one-third the
velocity of the stream. If this velocity be 3 feet per second, we
shall have v = 2. and we then get F = 7 lb. per sq. ft. very
nearly. Now 1 sq. meter = 10.76 sq. ft., and a speed of 1 ft. per
second (which is that of the rope) is 60 ft. per minute. Hence the
H.P. realized in the same case as that taken above will be 7
&times; 10.76 &times; 60 / 33,000 = 0.137 H.P. The difference
between the two values is very large, but Rankine, of course,
depends entirely on the value of the constant 1.8, which is quite
empirical, and is for a flat band instead of a hollow parachute.
Taking, however, his smaller figure, and an area of 544 square
inches, which Mr. Jagn has actually employed, we get a gross power
of = 0.137 &times; 544 = 7.43 H.P. Hence it will be seen that the
amount of power which can be realized by the system is far from
being inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may point out that the durability of the apparatus
will be considerable. There is no wear except at the moment when
the rope is passing round the drum, and even then there need be no
slipping or grinding. The apparatus worked in the Neva was in very
good condition after running for four months day and night. After
five months about one-fifth of the parachutes had to be replaced,
but after seven months the hemp rope still showed no signs of wear.
We think we have said enough to show that for certain purposes, and
especially, as we have, already mentioned, for irrigation purposes,
the new motor is well worthy of a careful and extended trial. It
may be questioned even whether we have not here the germ of an idea
which may hereafter enable us to solve one of the most interesting
and important of engineering problems, viz., the utilization of the
great store of power provided for us twice daily in the ebb and
flow of the tide.&mdash;<i>The Engineer.</i></p>

<h2>IMPROVED SHAFTING LATHE.</h2>

<p>Our engraving represents a new departure in shaft turning
lathes, and is the result of thirty years' experience in the
manufacture of shafting, with many years' study, to perfect a
machine of the greatest practical capacity and efficiency.</p>

<p class="ctr">IMPROVED SHAFTING LATHE.</p>

<p>The principal points of difference from a common engine lathe
are readily distinguished, among which may be mentioned the absence
of centers and tail stock, a traveling head with hollow driving
spindle, and a stationary tool rest and water tank. By dispensing
with a tail stock a much shorter bed may be used, and the hollow
driving spindle enables any length shaft to be turned, with one
setting of the tools. The tool rest is so arranged as to allow of
perfect lubrication of the tools, keeping the shaft cool, and at
the same time holding it perfectly rigid and strong; the operator
is not required to travel the length of the bed, but remains near
the driving belt, feed gearing, etc. Power is communicated to the
driving spindle by means of a sliding pinion on a splined rod
inside the bed, the driving belt and gears being at the end.</p>

<p>The driving head, after having traveled the length of the bed
and turned a shaft, is returned by a quick feed, and stops
automatically, allowing nearly time enough for the operator to
grind tools and be ready with another shaft, thus economizing the
time completely.</p>

<p>Wood, Jennison &amp; Co., Worcester, Mass., are the makers, and
they say that with a good quality of iron they have turned three
hundred feet of two inch iron in ten hours.</p>

<h2>POWER STRAIGHTENING MACHINE.</h2>

<p>The machine is provided with a pair of rolls at each end of the
bed, which are adjustable for different lengths of shaft, and are
made to revolve by power applied through suitable gearing and a
splined rod inside the bed; the bar of iron being placed on the
periphery of the rolls receives a rotary motion by friction, and
shows the crooked places in the same way and with the same ease as
though rotating on centers in the usual manner; vertically
adjustable blocks are arranged in the base of the press to support
the iron; power is applied by means of gearing to a splined rod at
the back of the machine, on which is a sliding clutch connecting,
at the will of the operator, with an eccentric; the eccentric
conveys motion and power through a link to the elbow joint at the
front of the press, which forces a plunger down against the
iron.</p>

<p>Sufficient adjustment is provided for different sizes of iron by
turning a nut at the top of the press.</p>

<p>Any point in the length of the bar can be reached by moving the

most laborious and disagreeable work in the process of making
shafting is rendered easy and rapid. Made by Wood, Jennison &amp;

<h2>HYDRAULIC MINING IN CALIFORNIA.</h2>

<h3>By GEORGE O'BRIEN.</h3>

<p>Our knowledge of the primitive operations of the aboriginal
inhabitants of the globe in pursuit of gold is barely traditional,
as we are only aware that from very early times the precious metal
was collected and highly prized by them, and that they chiefly
extracted the visible gold, which existed in prodigious quantities
on or closely beneath the surface of the earth, and of its being
particularly abundant in Asia and Africa. But we can draw more
positive conclusions as we survey remains of the rude but effective
contrivances used by them in later, but still remote, periods, with
full evidence as to the extent of their operations, in the numerous
perpendicular shafts located at short distances from each other,
over large areas of auriferous gravel in India, as well as from
precisely similar memorials of ancient workings which remain also
further demonstrations, in the abandoned "hill diggings," and
shifted beds, and beds of rivers, in Peru South America, flowing
between the sea and coast ranges of the Andes, descending in a
northeasterly direction to the river Amazon, and that their much
coveted and enormous productions were the accumulated riches of the
Incas, transferred as spoils of war to their Spanish conquerors in
the sixteenth century. And for similar explorations in the same
class of depositions we have the experiences of our own times, and
which explain by comparison all the previous operations alluded
to.</p>

<p>Thus in the year 1849, after the cession of the northern portion
of Mexico to the United States of North America, the rich mineral
district of California was at once invaded by hardy and intelligent
bands of mining adventurers from all parts of the world, who, with
little other means at their disposal but pick, shovel, and pan,
soon fell on the productive bars of rivers and rich ravines where
the gold was trapped, derived from its original birthplaces, where
it had been sparsely disseminated, to be dispersed by the
subsequent disintegrations and denudations of the mountains
themselves, and deposited in a disengaged form for the first comer;
and so perfect were sometimes these concentrations, in certain
localities where water once streamed, that, divested of its earthy
matrix, the cleansed pure metal was found deposited, detained by
its superior specific gravity, on the bare rock, and only hidden
from vision by a slight covering of vegetable mould. In this
manner, as an example of such concentration, a "pot" or "find" (in
mining parlance) to the value of &pound;10,000 was collected in a
space of 15 square yards, or within the limits of a particular
"mining claim," at the foot of Mokulumne Hill, in a southern county
of California, soon after the territorial transfer from Mexico. And
in search of such locations we must account for the numberless
shafts which still exist both in India and Peru, and sometimes sunk
within a few feet of each other, passing through the alluvium to a
depth of 40 feet to the bed rock.</p>

<p>These mining adventurers soon extended their explorations over
the other recently acquired territories, and built Virginia City,
the capital of Montana, with the gold derived from the alluvium of
a river channel which they excavated; and its inhabitants were the
founders of an institution called the Vigilance Committee, with
"Lynch law," and by it ruled supremely for many years. But their
surface diggings, by the manual operations alone of multitudes,
were soon exhausted in every direction, and then their energies and
powers of invention were dedicated to discover and explore deeper
and more permanent depositions, along the western slopes of the
Sierra Nevada, the Andes of the Western Territories, and which
originally were without doubt several miles higher than they are at
the present time&mdash;probably 20,000 feet above the
sea-level&mdash;and of which, or whatever superior elevation they
formerly had, the greater portion of it has already been removed,
by the continuous natural action of centuries, to form there, as
elsewhere, the plains and prairies of the earth, burying and
diverting by the mutation the ancient river system, whose sources
of supply were consequently extinguished by the removal of these
altitudes. These denudations and subsequent depositions have been
caused by alternations of temperature and combined action of air,
water, and time since the creation of the world; and powerful
demonstrations of these transformations instruct us in all
directions, if we care to observe them. Thus in "Little Cottonwood"
ravine, in the Wahsatch range of mountains in Utah Territory, lie
isolated in the center of the valley huge masses of metamorphic
granite, some blocks of which weigh individually thousands of tons,
and were dislodged from the hills&mdash;which on either side are of
limestone formation&mdash;with no visible granite in them, having
been undermined by the removal of their pulverized basis by
denudation, and which is the material now forming the tablelands,
the foundation, of Salt Lake City. The blocks of granite, having
alone resisted the atmospheric changes, were precipitated into the
valley beneath, and the Mormons are now constructing their
cathedral church from these granitic remains.</p>

<p>The melting of the snow which formerly capped all these ranges
of mountains furnished the water that once flowed in the
extinguished channels of ancient rivers, and whose now diverted
waters were also the powerful agent to assist in causing these
marvelous alternations; and by the means of hydraulic mining we can
advance our feeble knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>These mighty changes have gradually been accomplished, and the
accumulated denudations of the mineral zones have defended
themselves by strata of crystallized silicates of quartz of various
thicknesses, and thus in places beneath such system of defense, or
by their own concretion, have preserved in many localities a
thickness of from 500 to 600 feet of conglomerate, but without this
necessary cementation its further removal is very certain when
again attacked by water. An example of this continuous process is
very observable in "Death Valley," Lower California, where a width
of about 100 miles has been filled up from the hills to the gulf of
same name, invading and occupying its former bed; and this activity
is still proceeding, and a temporary formation of tableland above
it is in course of removal, although already overgrown with forest
trees, which are toppling over the side which is being attacked.
But eternal snow now only covers a small portion of these Sierras,
and a period of comparative repose may be expected, as the
distribution has already been far advanced by the excessive
reduction of the mountains.</p>

<p>The deep and extensive depositions which I now attempt to
describe attracted the early attention of the mining adventurers,
and were called "hill diggings," but not being properly understood
were therefore not immediately operated upon, and remained in
abeyance, while the lower, richer, and more manifest alluvials
endured. They were designated "blue gravel," the color being due to
the action of sulphuret of iron and other salts, the cementing
auxiliaries requisite to form the hard conglomerate, and on
exposure to the atmosphere changes color to yellow and violet,
losing also its firmness by oxidation.</p>

<p>The "great blue lead" is another important mining term and
designates the alluvium found reposing in a well-defined channel on
the bed rock, being the well-worn path of an ancient river; and it
is obvious that the material in these channels should be richer
than the general mass beyond their limits.</p>

<p>"Rim rock" is the boundary line of the banks of the old channel,
and, like the bottom, is well worn and corrugated by the running
water into cavities and "pot holes," where the force of the stream
eddied. The width of these channels varies from 60 to 400 feet, and
the cement near the rim and bottom is always richer than elsewhere.
The wider and deeper channels generally course from N. to N.W. The
richest and most explored belt of gold-bearing alluvium in
California lies between the South and Middle Yuba Rivers,
commencing near Eureka, in Nevada county, and extends downwards to
Smartsville and Timbuctoo, in Yuba county, a distance of 40 miles;
and from among snowy mountains the country falls gradually from
where the ravines or canons are cut by the actual rivers, which are
2,000 feet beneath the auriferous gravel and region near
Smartsville, and 2,000 feet above the Yuba River, where snow is
unknown, and near its terminus the ancient river bed courses more
westerly than it does above it, and crosses Yuba below Timbuctoo,
where the auriferous depositions disappear. The whole distance of
40 miles has been ransacked by the earlier adventurers, and around
the village of Timbuctoo was a center famed for its wonderful yield
of gold, obtained chiefly in the ravines, in holes, and depressions
in the bed rock. These hollows detained the concentrations of the
denudated alluvium from the altitudes, and were generally closely
beneath the surface, and by such guidance and means of discovery
the miners traced the gold up the ravines to their sources in the
lofty mounds and deposits, or hills of cemented conglomerate, near
Eureka in Nevada county; and by constructing canals from a higher
level began the new system of "hydraulic mining" and washing, and
gradually extended their operations over the area of the metallic
zone mentioned, of 40 miles long by 20 wide, using the Yuba River
below Timbuctoo to receive and discharge the tailings, or refuse
from their operations. The result in gold was considerable, but the
system is from its violent nature difficult to control, by
presuming to handle and remove such huge depositions in order to
collect the richest material. The idea was bold, being an
anticipation of Nature's operations; but the equitable disposal of
the "tailings" in a cultivated country is impossible, as the silt
runs down the rivers, creating banks and bars in their channels,
obstructing navigation and agricultural arrangements.</p>

<p>The first work to be accomplished, after calculating that the
amount or value of the material to be operated upon is sufficient
to guarantee the cost of the undertaking in general, is the
construction of a canal or canals, to convey the requisite volume
of water from the fountain-head, and of sufficient elevation to
command the ground to be worked upon, having also in view the
levels of the necessary tunnels and shafts as outlets for the
discharge of the gravel through them, these being engineering
operations requiring much skill and labor to avoid useless
after-cost.</p>

<p>Aqueducts of considerable elevation have to be constructed
across deep valleys, and the speculation is at all times
problematical, as the ground cannot be properly tested until the
water arrives upon it, and disputes may arise between the
shareholders of the canal and the mining company, ending frequently
in the one devouring the other, unless the two interests be quickly
amalgamated.</p>

<p>The starting point should be the lowest level, or "bed rock," on
the white cement in the ancient channel, which is probably the
original silt collected in it, and is harder than the conglomerate
above it, which is more easily removed. The courses of these beds
can be easily traced by landmarks and undulations, and occasional
exposures of the bed rock at low levels; also trial shafts are sunk
in various places in search of it, to a depth of 100 feet, passing
through blue gravel. The grades of these beds are not steep, being
from 10 to 40 feet per mile as of an ordinary river, and the
calculated thickness of the alluvial conglomerate is about 600 feet
in many places across the ridge between the South and Middle Yuba
River across the Columbia.</p>

<p>The power of the water for the operation is dependent on a given
volume deposited in a reservoir, and at sufficient elevation above
the points of discharge, as on this depends effectivity to tear
down the gravel. It is delivered to the miner by huge pipes made of
wrought iron, and laid down to follow the curvatures of the surface
of the ground; and the pipe I now treat of, belonging to the
Excelsior Water Company, has a diameter of 40 inches on a length of
6,000 feet, and 20 inches on the rest of its length of 8,000 feet,
being 9,000 feet in all; and this large pipe forms an inverted
siphon across a valley, following on the gravel, to the top of the
hill into the reservoir.</p>

<p>These pipes offer advantages over wooden aqueducts for spanning
chasms, and also to avoid coursing the sides of valleys; being also
cheaper to construct in general, and less liable to accidents from
fire and storms, and have the convenience for conveying the water
from point to point, as the work of excavation advances,
necessitating the removal of portions of the aqueduct forward. The
watershed, or reservoir, of the Excelsior Company embraces the
valley of the South Yuba and its affluents, and the entire cost of
its eight amalgamated canals was 750,000 dollars.</p>

<p>The rainfall during three years in the mountains averaged 49
inches annually, while the medium in the same period did not exceed
20 inches in the plains beneath. The height of the reservoir above
the tailing, or Yuba River, is 393 feet: and the height of the head
above the floor, or outlet sluice-tunnel, of the Blue Gravel Mining
Company was 197 feet.</p>

<p>The exact quantity of water required to wash every class of
gravel is difficult to estimate, but no quantity or pressure would
be excessive if properly arranged. The measurement of water is
effected by miner's inches, by allowing it to flow from the
reservoir of the seller to the purchaser through a box 10 or 12
feet square, with divisions to obtain a quiet head, with a slide or
opening capable of adjustment to any required measure; thus an
opening of 25 inches by 2 inches, with a quiet head of 6 inches
above the middle of the orifice, would give 50 inches, or about
89,259 cubic feet of water, flowing during ten hours per day, being
an amount necessary for a first-class operation. The capability of
the Excelsior Canal in rainy seasons reached to a delivery in
twenty-four hours, to the various mining companies, of 21,120,000
cubic feet of water, or 8,000 miner's inches, and the value of the
water paid for by the Blue Gravel Company in forty-three months
ending November 9, 1867, was 157,261 dollars, being at the rate of
15 cents of a dollar per miner's inch; and the proportion of water
used to wash down 989,165 cubic yards of gravel was 17,074,758
cubic yards, or 17&frac14; cubic yards of water to 1 cubic yard of
gravel; and when at work the quantity of gravel daily moved was
1,298 cubic yards, and the estimated cost to move one cubic yard of
gravel was 5 and 7/10 cents of a dollar. But in the face of
contingencies the Blue Gravel Company moved 1,000,000 cubic yards
of gravel in four years, or at the rate of 250,000 cubic yards per
annum, and the cost of washing each cubic yard stands thus:</p>

</table>

<p>Thus the gravel should contain gold to the value of 22 cents of
a dollar per cubic yard to cover cost, and the value of the gravel
referred to ranged from 20 to 45 cents per cubic yard; and the cost
of work done in shafts and tunnels, in the said Blue Gravel
Company's Mining claim, reached 100,000 dollars. But with the cost
of the necessary canals paid for by the Excelsior Water Company
apart, the total cost amounted to about 1,000,000 dollars, and we
must note that the latter company sold water to other mining
companies.</p>

<p>The gross yield in gold of the Blue Gravel Company in four years
was 837,399 dollars, and in the year 1866 the returns from the Blue
Gravel Company paid all the costs of the developments; but in 1867
assessments were paid by the owners to meet the deficiency arising
from the cost of sinking two new shafts, and driving fresh tunnels
on the lowest levels, which evidently contain on the bed rock the
richest concentrations.</p>

<p>In smaller mining adventures of this description, involving less
capital, large profits have been made in the gold-bearing zone
treated of, by also not having invested in costly canals, which
would not have repaid the latter investment; and thus it is evident
that the water companies are dependent blindly on the prosperity of
the miners.</p>

<p>I will now more minutely describe the actual mining operations.
The mining ground being selected, a tunnel is projected from the
nearest and most convenient ravine, so that the starting-point on
the bed rock toward the face of the ravine shall approach the
center of the material to be removed at a gradient of 1 in 10 to 1
in 30. The dimensions of such tunnels are usually 6 feet in width
by 7 in height, and continuing in contact with the hard river-bed,
for the greater ease of excavation, collection of gold, and
conservation of quicksilver amalgam.</p>

<p>These tunnels vary in length from a few hundred feet to a mile,
and some of the longer ones occupying from one to seven years in
execution, at a cost of from 10 to 60 dollars per foot of frontage.
The tunnel of the Blue Gravel Company, with length of 1,358 feet,
cost in labor alone 70,000 dollars, but it could now be driven for
35,000 dollars, as skilled labor is cheaper now than then. The
grade in this tunnel is about 12 per cent., and the end of the
tunnel is designed to be 170 feet of elevation, and reaching to a
point beneath the surface of the gravel which is being operated
upon, and where a shaft or incline is sunk to or through the bed
rock or gravel, until it intersects the tunnel.</p>

<p>The object of this laborious operation is obvious, as the long
tunnel becomes a sluiceway, and through the whole length of which
sluice boxes are laid, for the double motive of carrying off the
material and saving the gold, and for this purpose a trough of
strong planks is placed in the tunnel, 2&frac12; feet wide, and
with sides high enough to contain the stream. The pavement of the
trough is generally laid of blocks of wood 6 inches in thickness,
cut across the grain, and placed on their ends, to the width of the
sluiceway. The wooden blocks are usually alternated with sections
of stone pavement, the stones being set endwise, and in the
interstices between the stones and wooden blocks quicksilver is
distributed, and as much as 2 tons of this metal is required to
charge a long sluice. The water in the canal is brought by
aqueducts, or other means, to the head of the mining ground, having
an elevation of 100 to 200 ft. above the lowest level of the mining
ground, and is finally conveyed to it by iron pipes, sometimes
sustained on a strong incline of timber.</p>

<p>These pipes are of sheet iron, of adequate strength, riveted at
the joints, and measure from 12 to 20 inches in diameter, and
communicate at the bottom with a strong prismatic box of cast-iron,
on the top and sides of which are openings for the adaptation of
flexible tubes, made of very strong fabric of canvas, strengthened
by cording, and terminating in nozzles of metal of 2&frac12; to 3
inches in diameter. From these nozzles the streams of water are
directed against the face of the gravel to be washed, exercising
incredible effectivity.</p>

<p>The volume of water employed varies of course with the work to
be done; but it is not uncommon to see four such streams acting
simultaneously on the same bank, each conveying from 100 to 600
inches of water per hour&mdash;1,000 miner's inches being equal to
106,600 cubic feet of water per hour, constantly exerting its force
under a pressure of 90 to 200 pounds to the square inch, varying
with the height of the column.</p>

<p>Under the continuous action of this enormous force, aided by the
softening power of the water, large sections of the gravelly mass
are dislodged, and fall with great violence, the <i>debris</i>
speedily disintegrating and disappearing under the resistless force
of the water, and is hurried forward in the sluices to the mouth of
the shaft, down which it is precipitated with the whole volume of
turbid water. Bowlders of 100 to 200 lb. in weight are dislodged
and shot forward by the impetuous stream, accompanied by masses of
the harder cement which meet in the fall, and by the concussion
from the great bowlders the crushing and pulverizing agency
required is found to disintegrate it. The heavy banks, of 80 feet
and upward, are usually worked in two benches, the upper never
being so rich as the lower, and also less firm, and therefore
worked away with greater rapidity.</p>

<p>The lower section is much the more compact, as this stratum on
the bed rock being strongly cemented resists great pressure, and
even sometimes the full force of the streams of water, until it has
been loosened by gunpowder or other explosives. For this purpose
adits are driven in on its foundation-point of from 40 to 70 feet
and more from the face of the bank, and drifts are extended at
right angles therefrom to a short distance on each side of the
adit, and in these drifts a large quantity of gunpowder is placed
(from 1 to 3 tons), and fired at one blast, having been previously
built in with masonry. And in this manner the compact conglomerate
is broken up, and then the water easily completes its work.
Sometimes in the soft, upper strata the systems of tunnel is
extended, as in a coal-mine, by cross alleys, leaving blocks which
are afterward washed away, and then the whole mass settles, and is
disintegrated under the influence of water. The wooden sluices in
the tunnels already described are often made double for the
convenience of "cleaning up" one of them, while the other remains
in action. The process of cleaning up is performed according to the
quantity and richness of the material worked upon, at intervals of
twenty to forty days, and consists in removing the pavement and
blocks from the bed of the sluice, and then gathering all the
amalgam of gold and rich dirt collected, and replacing the locks in
the same way as at first. Advantage is taken on this occasion to
reverse the position of the blocks and stones when they are worn
irregularly, or substitute new ones for those which are worn
through. The mechanical action of the washing process on the blocks
is of course very rapid and severe, requiring complete renewal of
them once in eight to ten weeks. Some miners prefer a pavement of
egg-shaped stones set like a cobble-stone flooring, the gold being
deposited in the interstices. Most of the sluiceways are, however,
paved with rectangular wooden blocks, with or without stones as
described. Standing at the mouth of one of the long tunnels in full
action, any person unaccustomed to the process is struck with
astonishment, amounting almost to terror, as the muddy mass sweeps
onward, bearing in its course the great rolling bowlders, which add
their din to the roar of the water, the whole being precipitated
down a series of falls, at each of which it is caught up again by
new sluices of timber, lined like the first, and so onward and
downward many hundreds of feet until the level of the river is
reached, at a distance of about a half mile or more from the mouth
of the first tunnel.</p>

<p>At each of these new falls of 25 to 50 feet the process of
comminution begun in the first shaft is carried on, and a fresh
portion of gold obtained. Rude as this plan of saving gold appears
to be, more gold is procured by it than by any other method of
washing yet devised for this process of work, and the economical
advantages obtained by it cannot be surpassed, as it would be
impossible to handle such vast quantities of material in any other
way, and we can compare the cost of washing and handling a cubic
yard of auriferous gravel by it as follows:</p>

<p>But this process, even if effective or profitable as a mining
operation, may be prejudicial to the interests of the general
public, if conducted on a large scale, as the vast quantity of
material which it so suddenly removes is merely shifted into the
shallows beneath, to be redistributed by every freshet to points
lower and lower down until it reaches the sea-coast, creating bars
at the mouths of rivers in its course, and changing the hydrography
of harbors&mdash;as it has done with the Bay of San Francisco by
its silt.</p>

<p>The hills behind, torn up and washed by the gold miner, are
abandoned as desolate and irredeemable; and the costly canals,
constructed with peculiar conveniences for mining purposes,
eventually fall into disuse from being too expensive to maintain or
alter for general agricultural uses.&mdash;<i>Journal of

<h2>THE TREATMENT OF CHOLERA.</h2>

<p>From the host of remedies and suggestions that are now deluging
the European medical press, we select the following from Dr. Henry
A. Rawlins, in the <i>London Med. Times</i>, July 12. 1884:</p>

<p>The man suffering from cholera has been suddenly deprived by
diarrh&oelig;a of an enormous quantity of the fluid part of his
blood. This loss is one of simple transudation, increasing as the
powers of life decrease. This <i>sudden</i> loss produces intense
prostration, and renders the heart powerless to perfect the
circulation. The body, thus deprived of oxygen, speedily runs into
decomposition, even before life is extinct. Have we any agent by
which we can collect and press forward these scattered and
lethargic drops of blood to the heart, and enable it to renew the
circulation, and with it the blessings of oxygen to the body? My
reply is emphatically&mdash;Yes! Flannel bandages from the toes to
the trunk, around the abdomen, and from the fingers to the body,
will effect this object perfectly. Remark that the effect is
gradual, increasing with every turn of the roller, but would be in
full force in about twenty minutes. By thus exposing the blood in
the lungs to the action of oxygen in its diluted form, as it is in
the air, instead of pure oxygen, the reaction would neither be too
rapid nor too dangerous. In confirmation of my views, I have this
day learned that it is the custom in India to wear a double roll of
flannel around the abdomen, as a preventive to cholera. The other
advantages resulting from the use of the flannel bandages are:</p>

<ol>
<li>That they prevent the escape of heat from the body of the poor
creature who is already in a state of refrigeration.</li>

<li>By their firmly and equally grasping both flexor and extensor
muscles alike, they are steadied, and rendered much less likely to
be affected with spasmodic action or cramp.</li>

<li>By their steady<i>elastic</i> pressure and support of about 160
pounds, they persistently keep up and sustain the circulation of
the blood, which they had previously restored.</li>

<li>That the oxygen thus well secured to the blood will, I believe,
prove quite sufficient to neutralize the original poison, and also
destroy its effects.</li>

<li>That this much can at least be claimed for their use&mdash;that
they remove from nature a stumbling-block, which prevented her from
exercising her marvelous recuperative powers. Diluted sulphuric
acid is the best medicine to arrest the flux from the bowels,
acting also as a tonic. It should be given in five-minim doses
about every half hour, with rice gruel. By adopting this plan, the
natural process is brought about, that of the starch being
converted into grape sugar. Plenty of white of egg, well whipped
up, so as to nourish the body and convey oxygen into the stomach,
which it will appropriate, should be given. Opium, in small
quantities, and other stimulants, should be given according to the
necessities of the case. May it not be well, through the medium of
wet sponge over the thorax, to apply a continuous but gentle
current of galvanism, so as to stimulate the heart's action, keep
alive the respiratory movements, and thereby assist in the
maintenance of the functions of the body?</li>

<h2>TEMPERATURE, MOISTURE, AND PRESSURE IN THEIR RELATIONS TO
HEALTH.</h2>

<p>At the recent meteorological conference held at the Health
Exhibition, Dr. J.W. Tripe read a paper of much interest on some
relations of meteorological phenomena to health.</p>

<p>In ages long past these relations excited much attention, but
the knowledge concerning them was of the vaguest kind; and indeed,
even now, no very great advance has been made, because it is only
quite recently that we have been able to compare a fairly accurate
record of deaths with observations taken at a number of reliable
meteorological stations. The more useful and searching comparison
between cases of sickness, instead of deaths, and meteorological
phenomena has yet to be accomplished on a large scale in this
country, and especially as regards zymotic diseases. In Belgium
there is a Society of Medical Practitioners, embracing nearly the
whole country, that publishes a monthly record of cases of
sickness, of deaths, and of meteorological observations; but the
only attempt on a large scale in this country, which was started by
the Society of Medical Officers of Health for the whole of London,
failed partly from want of funds, and partly from irregularity in
the returns. My remarks, which must necessarily be very brief, will
refer to the relations between (1) meteorological phenomena and the
bodily functions of man, and (2) between varying meteorological
conditions and death-rates from certain diseases.</p>

<p>As regards the first, I will commence with a few brief remarks
on the effects of varying barometric pressures. A great deal too
much attention is paid to the barometer if we regard it as
indicating only, as it really does, variations in the weight of the
column of air pressing upon our bodies, because, except at
considerable elevations, where the barometer is always much lower
than at sea level, these variations produce but little effect on
health. At considerable elevations the diminished pressure
frequently causes a great feeling of malaise, giddiness, loss of
strength, palpitation, and even nausea; and at greater heights, as
was noticed by Mr. Glaisher in a very lofty balloon ascent, loss of
sight, feeling, and consciousness. These were caused by a want of a
sufficient supply of oxygen to remove effete matters from the
system, and to carry on the organic functions necessary for the
maintenance of life. On elevated mountain plateaus, or even in high
residences among the Alps, an increased rapidity in the number of
respirations and of the pulse, as well as increased evaporation
from the lungs and skin, occur.</p>

<p>For some years past, many persons suffering from consumption,
gout, rheumatism, and an&aelig;mic affections have gone to mountain
stations, chiefly in Switzerland, for relief, and many have derived
much benefit from the change. It must not, however, be supposed
that diminished atmospheric pressure was the chief cause of the
improvement in health, as its concomitants, viz., a diminution in
the quantity of oxygen and moisture contained in each cubic foot of
air, probably the low temperature, with a total change in the daily
habits of life, have assisted in the beneficial results. The
diminution in the quantity of air, and consequently of oxygen,
taken in at each breath is to a certain extent counterbalanced by
an increased frequency and depth of the respirations, and a greater
capacity of the chest. In this country, alterations in the
barometric pressure are chiefly valuable as indicating an
approaching change in the wind, and as well as of the amount of
moisture in the air; hence the instrument is often called "the
weather glass." A sudden diminution in the atmospheric pressure is
likely to be attended with an escape of ground air from the soil,
and therefore to cause injury to health, especially among the
occupants of basement rooms, unless the whole interior of the
building be covered with concrete.</p>

<p><i>Temperature.</i>&mdash;Experience has shown that man can bear
greater variations of temperature than any other animal, as in the
Arctic regions a temperature of -70 degrees Fahrenheit, or more
than 100 degrees below freezing point, can be safely borne; that he
can not only live but work, and remain in good health, in these
regions provided that he be supplied with suitable clothing and
plenty of proper food. On the other hand, man has existed and taken
exercise in the interior of Australia when the thermometer showed a
temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit, or nearly 90 degrees above
freezing point, so that he can live and be in fairly good health
within a range of nearly 200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The effects of a high temperature vary very much according to
the amount of moisture in the air, as when the air is nearly
saturated in hot climates, or even in summer in our own, more or
less languor and malaise are felt, with great indisposition to
bodily labor. With a dry air these are not so noticeable. The cause
is evident; in the former case but little evaporation occurs from
the skin, and the normal amount of moisture is not given off from
the lungs, so that the body is not cooled down to such an extent as
by dry air. Sunstroke is probably the result, not only of the
direct action of the sun's rays, but partly from diminished cooling
of the blood by want of evaporation from the lungs and skin.</p>

<p>The effects of temperature on man do not depend so much on the
mean for the day, month, or year, as on the extremes, as, when the
days are hot and the nights comparatively cool, the energy of the
system becomes partially restored, so that a residence near the
sea, or in the vicinity of high mountains, in hot climates is,
other things being equal, less enervating than in the plains, as
the night air is generally cooler. It is commonly believed that hot
climates are <i>necessarily</i> injurious to Europeans, by causing
frequent liver derangements and diseases, dysentery, cholera, and
fevers. This, however, is, to a certain extent, a mistake, as the
recent medical statistical returns of our army in India show that
in the new barracks, with more careful supervision as regards diet
and clothing, the sickness and death-rates are much reduced.
Planters and others, who ride about a good deal, as a rule keep in
fairly good health; but the children of Europeans certainly
degenerate, and after two or three generations die out, unless they
intermarry with natives, and make frequent visits to colder
climates. This fact shows that hot climates, probably by
interfering with the due performance of the various processes
concerned in the formation and destruction of the bodily tissues,
eventually sap the foundations of life among Europeans; but how far
this result has been caused by bad habits as regards food,
exercise, and self-indulgence, I cannot say. Rapid changes of
temperature in this country are often very injurious to the young
and old, causing diarrh&oelig;a and derangements of the liver when
great heat occurs, and inflammatory diseases of the lungs, colds,
etc., when the air becomes suddenly colder, even in summer.</p>

<p>The <i>direct</i> influence of rain on man is not very marked in
this country, except by giving moisture to the air by evaporation
from the ground and from vegetable life, and by altering the level
of ground water. This is a subject almost overlooked by the public,
and it is therefore as well that it should be known that when
ground water has a level persistently less than five feet from the
surface of the soil, the locality is usually unhealthy, and should
not, if possible, be selected for a residence. Fluctuations in the
level of ground water, especially if great and sudden, generally
cause ill-health among the residents. Thus, Dr. Buchanan in his
reports to the Privy Council in 1866-1867, showed that consumption
(using the word in its most extended sense) is more prevalent in
damp than on dry soils, and numerous reports of medical officers of
health, and others, which have been published since then, show that
an effective drainage of the land, and consequent carrying away of
the ground water, has been followed by a diminution of these
diseases.</p>

<p>Varying amounts of moisture in the air materially affect the
health and comfort of man. In this country, however, it is not only
the absolute but the relative proportions of aerial moisture which
materially influence mankind. The quantity of aqueous vapor that a
cubic foot of air can hold in suspension, when it is saturated,
varies very much with the temperature. Thus at 40 degrees Fahr. it
will hold 2.86 grains of water; at 50 degrees, 4.10 grains; at 60
degrees, 5.77 grains; at 70 degrees, 8.01 grains; and at 90 degrees
as much as 14.85 grains. If saturation be represented by 100, more
rapid evaporation from the skin will take place at 70 degrees, and
75 per cent. of saturation, than at 60 degrees when saturated,
although the absolute quantity of moisture in the air is greater at
the first named temperature than at the latter. As regards the
lungs, however, the case is different, as the air breathed out is,
if the respirations be regular and fairly deep, completely
saturated with moisture at the temperature of the body. In cold
climates the amount of moisture and of the effete matters given off
from the lungs in the expired air is much greater than in hot
climates, and the body is also cooled by the evaporation of water
in the form of aqueous vapor. Moist air is a better conductor of
heat than dry air, which accounts for much of the discomfort felt
in winter when a thaw takes place as compared with the feeling of
elasticity when the air is dry. In cold weather, therefore, moist
air cools down the skin and lungs more rapidly than dry air, and
colds consequently result. London fogs are injurious, not only on
account of the various vapors given off by the combustion of coal,
but in consequence of the air being in winter generally saturated
with moisture at a low temperature. The injuriousness of fogs and
low temperatures will be presently dwelt upon at greater
length.</p>

<p>Variations in the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere
exert a considerable influence on the circulation of air contained
in the soil, which is called ground air. As all the interstices of
the ground are filled with air or water, the more porous the soil,
the greater is the bulk of air. The quantity of air contained in
soil varies very much according to the material of which the soil
is composed, as it is evident that in a gravelly or sandy soil it
must be greater than when the ground consists of loam or clay. The
estimates vary from 3 to 30 per cent., but the latter is probably
too high. If, therefore, a cesspool leak into the ground, the
offensive effluvia, if in large quantities, will escape into the
soil, and are given off at the surface of the ground, or are drawn
into a house by the fire; but, if small, they are rendered
innocuous by oxidation. The distance to which injurious gases and
suspended or dissolved organic matters may travel through a porous
soil is sometimes considerable, as I have known it pass for 130
feet along a disused drain, and above 30 feet through loose
soil.</p>

<p>Winds exercise a great effect on health both directly and
indirectly. Directly, by promoting evaporation from the skin, and
abstracting heat from the body in proportion to their dryness and
rapidity of motion. Their indirect action is more important, as the
temperature and pressure of the air depend to a great extent on
their direction. Thus winds from the north in this country are
usually concomitant with a high barometer and dry weather; in
summer with a pleasant feeling, but in winter with much cold.
Southwest winds are the most frequent here of any, as about 24 per
cent. of the winds come from this quarter against 16&frac12; from
the west, 11&frac12; from the east, and the same from the
northeast; 10&frac12; from the south, 8 from the north, and a
smaller number from the other quarters. Southwest winds are also
those which are most frequently accompanied by rain, as about 30
per cent. of the rainy days are coincident with southwest winds.
Another set of observations give precisely the same order, but a
considerable difference in their prevalence, viz., southwest 31 per
cent., west 14&frac12;, and northeast 11&frac12; per cent. Easterly
winds are the most unpleasant, as well as the most injurious to man
of all that occur in this country.</p>

<p>I now propose discussing very briefly the known relations
between meteorological phenomena and disease. I say the known
relations, because it is evident that there are many unknown
relations of which at present we have had the merest glimpse. For
instance, small-pox, while of an ordinary type, and producing only
a comparatively small proportion of deaths to those attacked, will
sometimes suddenly assume an epidemic form, and spread with great
rapidity at a time of year and under the meteorological conditions
when it usually declines in frequency. There are, however, in this
country known relations between the temperature and, I may say,
almost all diseases. As far back as 1847 I began a series of
elaborate investigations on the mortality from scarlet fever at
different periods of the year, and the relations between this
disease and the heat, moisture, and electricity of the air. I then
showed that a mean monthly temperature below 44.6&deg; F. was
adverse to the spread of this disease, that the greatest relative
decrease took place when the mean temperature was below 40&deg;,
and that the greatest number of deaths occurred in the months
having a mean temperature of between 45&deg; and 57&deg; F.
Diseases of the lungs, excluding consumption, are fatal in
proportion to the lowness of the temperature and the presence of
excess of moisture and fog. Thus, in January, 1882, the mean weekly
temperature fell from 43.9&deg; F. in the second week to 36.2&deg;
in the third, with fog and mist. The number of deaths registered in
London during the third week, which may be taken as corresponding
with the meteorological conditions of the second week, was 1,700,
and in the next week 1,971. Unusual cold, with frequent fogs and
little sunshine, continued for four weeks, the weekly number of
deaths rising from 1,700 to 1,971, 2,023, 2,632, and 2,188. The
deaths from acute diseases of the lungs in these weeks were
respectively 279, 481, 566, 881, and 689, showing that a large
proportion of the excessive mortality was caused by these diseases.
At the end of November and in December of the same year there was a
rapid fall of temperature, when the number of deaths from acute
diseases of the lungs rose from 297 to 358, 350, 387, 541, 553, and
389 in the respective weeks. From November 29 to December 9 the sun
was seen only on two days for 4&frac12; hours, and from December 9
to the 18th also on two other days for less than 4 hours, making
the total amount of sunshine 8.1 hours only in 20 days. In January
and February the excess of weekly mortality from all diseases
reached the large number of 504 deaths; in December it was less,
the fogs not having been so dense, but the excess equaled 246
deaths per week.</p>

<p>The relations between a high summer temperature and excessive
mortality from diarrh&oelig;a have long been well known, but the
immediate cause of the disease as an epidemic is not known. Summer
diarrh&oelig;a prevails to a greater extent in certain localities,
notably in Leicester (and has done so for years); and the cause has
been carefully sought for, but has not been found out. Recent
researches, however, point to a kind of bacillus as the immediate
cause, as it has been found in the air of water-closets, in the
traps under the pans, and in the discharges from infants and young
children. In order to indicate more readily how intimately the
mortality from diarrh&oelig;a depends on temperature, I now lay
before you a table showing the mean temperature for ten weeks in
summer, of seven cold and hot summers, the temperature of Thames
water, and the death-rates of infants under one year per million
population of London:</p>

<p>As may be seen, the deaths of infants under 1 year of age from
diarrh&oelig;a per 1,000,000 population was only 151; while the
mean summer temperature was only 58.1&deg; F. against 189 in 1862,
when the mean temperature was 59.0&deg;. In 1879, when the mean
temperature was 58.7&deg;, the deaths from diarrh&oelig;a rose to
228 per million, but a few days were unusually hot. In 1877 the
mean temperature of the air was 61.2&deg;, of the Thames water
63.3&deg;, and the mortality of infants from diarrh&oelig;a 347 per
million population. In 1874, when the mean temperature of the air
was 61.7&deg;, the mortality rose to 447 per million; and in the
hot summers of 1878 and 1876, when the mean air temperatures were
64.1&deg; and 64.9&deg; respectively, the death-rates of infants
were 576 and 642 per million population. The relations, therefore,
between a high summer temperature and the mortality from
diarrh&oelig;a in infants are very intimate. I have selected the
mortality among infants in preference to that at all ages, as the
deaths occur more quickly, and because young children suffer in
greater proportion than other persons.</p>

<p>The proportionate number of deaths at <i>all ages</i> from
diarrh&oelig;a corresponds pretty closely with those of infants. To
prove this, I made calculations for three years, and ascertained
that only 3.9 per cent. of all the deaths from this disease were
registered in the weeks having a temperature of less than 50&deg;;
11.9 per cent. in the weeks having a temperature between 50&deg;
and 60&deg;; while in the comparatively few weeks in which the
temperature exceeded 60&deg; F., as many as 84.2 per cent. of the
total number of deaths was registered. In the sixteen years,
1840-56, for which many years ago I made a special inquiry, only
18.9 per cent. of all the deaths from diarrh&oelig;a occurred in
winter and spring, against 81.1 per cent. in summer and autumn. In
the twenty years, 1860-79, there were seven years in which the
summer temperature was in defect when the mortality per 100,000
inhabitants of London was 200; while in ten summers, during which
the temperature was in excess by 2&deg; or less, the mortality was
317 per 100,000. The mean temperature was largely in excess, that
is to say, more than 2&deg; plus in three of these summers, when
the mortality reached 339 per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>These figures show that great care should be taken in hot
weather to prevent diarrh&oelig;a, especially among young children;
by frequent washing with soap and water to insure cleanliness, and
proper action of the skin; by great attention to the food,
especially of infants fed from the bottle; free ventilation of
living rooms, and especially of bedrooms; and by protection, as far
as possible, being afforded from a hot sun, as well as by avoiding
excessive exercise. All animal and vegetable matter should be
removed from the vicinity of dwelling-houses as quickly as possible
(indeed, these should be burnt instead of being put in the
dust-bin), the drains should be frequently disinfected and well
flushed out, especially when the mean daily temperature of the air
is above 60&deg; F.</p>

<p>Time will not admit of more than a mere mention of the relations
between meteorological phenomena and the mortality from many other
diseases and affections, such as apoplexy from heat, sunstroke,
liver diseases, yellow fever, cholera, whooping-cough, measles,
etc., especially as the state of our knowledge on the subject is so
very limited. A comparison between the mortality from several
diseases in this and other countries shows that certain of these do
not prevail under closely corresponding conditions. Thus the curves
of mortality from whooping-cough, typhoid fever, and scarlet fever
do not correspond with the curves of temperature in both London and
New York, and the same may be said of diarrh&oelig;a in India. It
is therefore evident that some other cause or causes than a varying
temperature must be concerned in the production of an increased
death-rate from these diseases. The subject is of great importance,
and I do not despair of our obtaining some day a knowledge of the
agents through which meteorological phenomena act in the production
of increased and decreased death rates from certain diseases, and
the means by which, to a certain extent, these injurious effects on
man may be presented.</p>

<h2>CONSUMPTION SPREAD BY CHICKENS.</h2>

<p>In a village, C., near Weimar, where for many years no case of
tubercular phthisis had taken place, two years ago several families
suddenly discovered one of their members to be suffering from the
disease. After a long inquiry, it was discovered by accident that
all these families had been buying their spring chickens from one
and the same place, viz., from a private hospital in the
neighborhood. A medical student brought the livers of two such
chickens to Prof. Johne, in Dresden. The student, whose own sister
had become affected with consumption, had lived during his vacation
at home with his parents, in C., and he had there at dinner
observed the peculiar appearance of the liver of the chickens.</p>

<p>On examination, both organs were found to be full of tubercular
bacilli. A thorough investigation was at once instituted, and it
was then that the fact came to light that the chickens eaten by the
families, members of which had been affected with tuberculosis, had
all been brought from the institution mentioned. On further inquiry
at the latter place the following facts were elicited:</p>

<p>At about the time when the first case of consumption occurred in
the village, an inmate or the hospital, Mrs. R., had died of the
disease. Before her death, Mrs. R. used to feed the chickens raised
there; she was often seen first to chew the meat before she gave it
to the chickens. Further, the spittoons were emptied on a place in
the yard where the chickens generally came to pick up any stray
corn.</p>

<p>As none of the chickens ever came in contact with any animals in
the neighborhood&mdash;the hospital being situated at a
considerable distance from the village&mdash;as no disease had
happened among them until the arrival of Mrs. R., when soon after
an epidemic seemed to break out among them, and many died, there is
no doubt that they contracted the disease from Mrs. R., and in
return infected those who ate their flesh.</p>

<p>The case is very interesting, first, as it proves how such
animals may become affected, then how they may spread the disease,
and lastly, that some kind of a disposition must exist in the
person infected; for here, of many who had eaten of the diseased
flesh, only a few contracted the malady. The whole report teaches
us how careful we have to be, and how necessary is the appointment
of skillful experts by the State to inspect all food offered for
sale.&mdash;<i>Med. and Surg. Reporter.</i></p>

<h2>NEW METHOD OF REDUCING FEVER.</h2>

<p>For many years eminent medical savants have sought earnestly
through the vegetable and mineral worlds for some substance by
means of which the high temperature often prevailing in typhoid,
malarial, and other fevers might be reduced with rapidity and
safety to the patient. A few substances have been found which
produce a decline in temperature when administered in enormous and
frequently repeated doses; but such administration has often been
found to be decidedly detrimental to the patient, producing not
infrequently serious injury to the stomach, kidneys, and sometimes
the nervous system. So great is the danger of such injurious
results, few careful practitioners have cared to adopt the heroic
"antipyretic" medication recommended by experimenters, preferring
to allow their patients to burn with fever, mitigated only by such
simple means as are commonly employed by nurses, than to require
them to combat the poisonous influences of a drug in addition to
the morbid element of the disease.</p>

<p>Happily, however, it is not necessary to leave the patient to
the unaided efforts of nature. By cool sponging of the surface,
persistently and thoroughly applied; by large, cool compresses
placed over the abdomen and chest, or even the whole front of the
body, and changed as often as warm, or every three to five minutes;
by frequently repeated cool packs; by cold water drinking; by
ice-packs to the spine; by constant application of ice or frozen
compresses to the head; by forcing perspiration by copious hot
drinks and a warm blanket pack&mdash;by any or all of these means
the temperature may be reduced with promptness in nearly every
case. However, cases will now and then occur in which the
temperature remains dangerously high, notwithstanding the thorough
application of the above means. What shall be done?</p>

<p>Several years ago our attention was called to a series of
experiments made by Dr. Winternitz, Professor of Hydropathy in the
Medical University of Vienna, for the purpose of determining the
influence upon temperature of enemas of water of different
temperature in cases of fever. The results claimed by Prof.
Winternitz were so striking that we improved the first opportunity
to repeat his experiments, and with such results as have justified
the continued use of this means of lowering temperatures in fever,
in cases in which the ordinary measures were not efficient. The
only objection we have found to the method has been the
inconvenience to the patient occasioned by the frequent use of the
bed-pan. In a recent case in which we found it necessary to resort
to this method, the nurse observed that if the tin can of the
fountain syringe used in administering the enema happened to be
lowered below the level of the bed on which the patient lay, water
which had previously been introduced into the rectum returned
readily through the tube into the can. On learning this fact, the
attendants were instructed to employ the enema in this way. From
one to two pints of water, of 70&deg; or 75&deg; F. temperature,
were allowed to pass into the bowels; and after being retained for
five or ten minutes, or until the patient experienced uncomfortable
sensations, it was made to pass out through the tube by simply
lowering the reservoir to the level of the floor. A new supply of
water of a proper temperature being introduced into the reservoir,
it was again raised to the proper height, and the operation so
continued until six quarts of water had been used. Then the patient
was allowed to rest half an hour or an hour, according to the
height of the fever, and the same process was repeated. Careful
record was made of the temperature of the patient just before the
treatment and immediately after. It was found to be invariably
reduced from one to one and a half degrees by each treatment. The
temperature, which had been exceedingly obstinate previous to the
employment of this method, ranging from 104&deg; to 105&deg;,
during the intervals between the treatments would, of course, rise
somewhat; but each time it stopped short of the point reached
during the previous interval, so that in the course of a few hours
the fever was brought down to very nearly a normal temperature. The
temperature of the water, when taken after passing through the
bowels, was found to have risen each time from 10&deg; to
13&deg;.</p>

<p>The great capacity of water for absorbing heat renders it one of
the most useful of all substances for lowering the temperature; and
it is readily apparent that, by the means described, heat may be
abstracted from the body almost <i>ad libitum</i>, and the
temperature may thus be controlled with a rapidity and a degree of
certainty which cannot be approached by any other method. In a
still more recent case, in which the same treatment was employed,
the temperature of the patient had reached 106&deg; F., in spite of
the vigorous application of ordinary measures of treatment, such as
cold compresses, etc.; but it was, in four or five hours, brought
down to nearly 100&deg; by the use of the cold enemas.</p>

<p>The advantages of this method are: 1. It may be employed without
wetting or moving the patient; very frequently a patient will sleep
continuously during the administration of the treatment. 2. It
seldom causes chilliness, which is frequently a disturbing symptom,
especially in fevers of a low type, and even, when the temperature
is alarmingly high, causing the patient to dread the employment of
sponging with cool or tepid water. 3. It is not necessary to employ
cold water, a temperature of 80&deg; or even 85&deg; being
thoroughly efficient. In the majority of cases, however, water of
70&deg; or even 60&deg; may be employed without danger. The water
comes in such immediate contact with surfaces filled with large
blood-vessels that a temperature but a few degrees below that of
the body is more effective than very much colder water applied to
the surface.</p>

<p>In cases in which the use of the cool enema is attended by
chilliness, this uncomfortable symptom may usually be relieved by
the application of a hot bag or fomentations to the spine or to the
pit of the stomach.</p>

<p>The simple measures of treatment we have described will be found
more effective in lowering the temperature than any or all other
remedies which have ever been recommended for this
purpose.&mdash;<i>Good Health.</i></p>

<p class="ctr">FIG 1.&mdash;THE CROWN DIAMONDS OF FRANCE AT THE
EXHIBITION OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS.</p>

<p>According to a recent law of Parliament, a large part of the
crown jewels of France is destined to be sold. The exhibit that has
been made of these riches for the last two months at the National
Exhibition of the Industrial Arts, in the State Hall of the Louvre,
has excited a lively interest among the visitors. Here are to be
seen, heaped up in a large octagonal show-case, incomparable
treasures, whose value exceeds quite a number of millions.
According to the inventory of 1818, the 52,000 precious stones of
the crown of France were estimated as worth more than 20 million
francs ($4,000,000); but since that epoch the stones have increased
in number, and money has singularly diminished in value, so that
the total at present would be much less.</p>

<p class="ctr">FIG. 2.&mdash;THE REGENT. (Actual Size.)</p>

<p>In order to publicly exhibit so valuable treasures it was
necessary to take precautions against thieves and fire, and this
was done in a very sure and ingenious manner. The collection of
crown jewels is distributed over the eight faces of an octagonal
truncated cone, which is supported by a framework about three feet
in height at the lower part. The stand is exhibited every day, at
ten o'clock in the morning and six in the evening, under an elegant
octagonal show-case surmounted by a high bronze statue of Fortune
by Barbedienne. The whole is covered with a canopy, as shown in
Fig. 1.</p>

<p>A force of guardians of the Treasury is detailed to watch over
the crown jewels, and it is to them that is confided the care of
operating in the morning and evening the safety mechanism that we
shall describe. The object of this mechanism is to lower into and
lift out of the strong-box the entire stand with all its
jewels.</p>

<p>A winch, shown at A to the right of the engraving, sets in
motion a system of gear wheels keyed at an angle, at B and C, upon
intermediate shafts that transmit motion to the four vertical
threaded rods of the frame, D. All these shaftings are 1&frac12;
inch in diameter, and the cog-wheels, twenty in number, are about 5
inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The well is formed of an octagonal wall of fire-brick, and is 20
inches thick and 6 feet high. In the center of this masonry is
embedded very thick iron plate. The bottom of the well is isolated
from the flooring of the Exhibition hall by a thickness of boiler
plate, by a filling of tire bricks, and finally by a second
thickness of boiler plate. The well is closed by means of a large
plate of iron 6 inches thick, 10 feet in length, and 88 feet in
width. The winch which maneuvers this mass is placed at E. It
actuates a system of bevel wheels, keyed at F, which transmit
motion to two horizontal screws (hidden under the stage) that
actuate the plate, H. This latter is provided with two parallel
series of five rollers each that revolve over long and strong
pieces of wood covered with rails. Electric alarms are located near
the winches.</p>

<p>A fire-engine station is located at within twelve or fifteen
feet of the exhibition building.</p>

<p>A committee composed of competent jewelers and mineralogists has
been appointed to make an appraisement of the diamonds and to
indicate such as should be withheld from sale on account of their
scientific, artistic, or historic interest. The members of the
committee propose to preserve the following objects:</p>

<p>1. The "Regent" (Fig. 2), by reason of its mineralogical value,
the perfection of its cutting, the purity of its water, its
incomparable luster, and its great size, it being the largest
brilliant as yet known.</p>

<p>2. The military sword of Charles the Tenth's coronation, the
hilt of which is entirely of brilliants mounted by Bapst with
wonderful art.</p>

<p>3. The jewel called the "Reliquary," of the 15th century.</p>

<p>To these riches must be added the following interesting objects:
the Dey of Algiers' watch; the Elephant of Denmark; the
decorations, etc., of foreign orders; crowns and diadems of
sapphire; rubies; pearls that afford curious specimens of French
art at the beginning of our century; one of the Mazarins bequeathed
by the celebrated Cardinal; and lots of colored stones destined for
our national museums.</p>

<p>The same exhibition alluded to above contains a number of other
collections of great interest that it would be unjust to pass over
in silence, such as the exhibit of the French diamond mines of the
Cape, where one may see all the details of this prosperous
exploitation by means of photographs and specimens. The art
bronzes, the objects of jewelry, of goldsmith's work, and of
morocco work, the music boxes, Trouve's and Aboilard's electric
jewelry, and the retrospective art collections especially attracted
the attention of the public.&mdash;<i>La Nature.</i></p>

<h2>A NEW MODE OF TESTING THE ECONOMY OF THE EXPENSES OF MANAGEMENT
IN LIFE INSURANCE.</h2>

<p>How to determine the general ratios of the expenses of
management of life insurance companies has hitherto been an
unsettled question, and I think no serious attempt has been made
before my own to study this question exhaustively, and reach a
scientific conclusion.</p>

<p>Believing that, one is contained in the following statement, I
respectfully submit it to the criticism of others.</p>

<p>It has generally been taken for granted that the measure of
economy of life insurance expenses may be expressed by the single
ratio of expenses to one feature of the business, such as the
premium income, or the total income (premium and interest), or the
mean amount of all policies outstanding. But this is not the case.
No exhaustive reason has been shown for preferring one of these
bases of ratio to another, and, indeed, no reason well supported by
argument has been shown for employing either. On the other hand, no
better evidence is needed of the importance of establishing a
uniform and demonstrably sound basis, than the fact that it is
common for companies to refute one another's claims to superior
economy, and totally confuse the public, by opposing ratios found
in one way by ratios found in another&mdash;that one of two
companies which appears the most economical according to one test
being apparently the least so according to another.</p>

<p>The economy of the expense of any transaction, or work, can only
be intelligently judged by the value of the <i>result</i>. This
truth is too well recognized to need illustration, and it only
needs to be called to mind, to perceive both the error of ratios of
expense based on premium, which is not the result but the <i>raw
material</i>, so to speak, of insurance transactions; and what, on
the contrary, the true basis is.</p>

<p>It is thus clear that in insurance the economy of expense must
be judged, not by comparison with the premiums paid, but by
comparison specifically with the resulting advantages in fact
secured by such payments. Now these are of two kinds: which may be
called the <i>insurance advantage</i> and the <i>investment
advantage</i>.</p>

<p>(1) Each death claim paid is an insurance advantage, though it
is so only to the extent of the excess of the amount of the policy
which has become a claim over its premium reserve, or value, for
the latter being the balance (with interest) of the policy holder's
own premium money, could have been left or secured to his
representatives without the intervention of the policy and
company.</p>

<p>It is true that the advantage or benefit of insurance does not
consist in adding anything to the wealth of a company, but only
consists in drawing from the premiums paid into its treasury by the
policy holders generally, to meet each death claim which arises; or
can only be called an <i>advantage of distribution</i>, or process
of collecting aid from the living members, to assist the
representatives or dependents of the deceased ones; but it is not
the less on this account an advantage worth <i>same expense</i> in
securing.</p>

<p>(2) Interest realized by the investment of premium while it is
in the keeping of a company is an advantage; in every sense so,
since it comes wholly from outside sources, and accrues
proportionally to all members; it may be called, as above, the
investment advantage, and of course justifies some <i>expense</i>
to secure it.</p>

<p>Hence the expenses incurred by any company in a given; time must
be divided into two parts, one being the expense incidental to
insurance, and the other that incidental to investment, which parts
are to be compared respectively with the insurance claims met, and
interest receipts of the company for the same time; or what is
equivalent in the latter case, the net rate of interest earned
after deducting the incidental investment expense may be found.</p>

<p>When this process shows that one company has earned a higher
rate of interest than another, at the same time that its insurance
expenses bear a lower ratio to its insurance claims paid, <i>there
is no escape from the conclusion that during the period under
observation it has served its policy-holders more economically</i>,
and the test is therefore scientific. Though, if one company shows
a higher rate of interest, while the other shows a lower ratio of
insurance expense, it will still be necessary, to complete the
test, to equate either the rates of interest or the ratios of
insurance expense (it does not practically matter which), and note
how this affects the relation of the duly corrected ratios on the
other score.</p>

<p>To be exact, if the average vitality of the members of the two
companies differ (other things being equal, it is always cheapest
to belong to that company which has the lowest death rate), the
ratios of insurance expense to expected, as well as actual, claims
of each must be found, and equated.</p>

<p>The science of this procedure, or mode of testing expenses, and
also its practical simplicity, may be more clearly perceived by
reference to its practical application in the following table:</p>

<p>The figures given in this table are drawn from the last annual
report of the Insurance Commissioner of Massachusetts, excepting
the premium reserve on death claims, which, as well as the division
of the total expenses of each company into insurance and investment
expenses, I have estimated on a uniform rule. This was for lack of
the actual data in these particulars, which the report did not
give, as it is desirable that future ones may.</p>

<p>This, however, does not injure the value of the table for
illustrating the mode of procedure, for which purpose mainly it is
presented. The companies whose figures I have used, moreover, have
no occasion to complain of this, as my estimate certainly gives all
ratios of insurance expense lower than they would appear if I had
known, and used, the exact actual premium reserve on death claims,
and all probably bear nearly the same ratio to each other as they
would in that case.</p>

<p>As the object of this statement is to explain the new method,
and not to defend my particular estimates in applying it, I forbear
to state on what rules I have made them. Expense which is not
ascribed to insurance must be ascribed to investment, and as in
comparing any two companies, their two ratios of one kind or the
other must be equated, to decide the question of economy between
them, it may well be left to any company to say what the fair
division of its own expenses is.</p>

<p>Moreover, there can be but little motive to make a false
division; for to successfully compete for business, a company
having large investments has as much need to show a high net rate
of interest earned as a low rate of insurance expense. Again, it is
not my purpose to pass judgment on the economy or extravagance of
any ratio of expense shown in the table. It is not a fact exhibited
for the first time by my figures, that the ratios of some companies
are more than double those of others. The same fact would be
displayed in about as high a degree by ratios based on premium
income, or any other incorrect basis. Custom, the balance of
opinions, and competition may well be left to decide what ratios of
expense are high, and what are average, or low. And their decision
is to be gathered only from <i>statistics</i>.</p>

<p>What I do claim is that the mode of determining ratios herein
explained is the only intelligible and scientific one, and the only
one proper to employ in <i>statistical tabulations</i> and
<i>investigations</i>.</p>

<p>As such, it calls attention to the fact that the amount of
insurance claims met, and of interest receipts, <i>are limits</i>
which the corresponding expenses cannot exceed, certainly for a
series of years together, without making the <i>expense</i> more
than the <i>advantage</i> of the business. To keep this fact in
view, <i>as a preventive of extravagance</i>, is not the least
valuable service the new mode may render. It may be seen that there
are eight cases in the table, in which the ratio of insurance
expense points to expenses exceeding the insurance claims met in
the same time, yet the reader need not hasten to conclude that the
same companies will permanently show similar ratios, or have no
good reasons to give for the ones which now appear. I may remark,
however, that it is an evidence of the scientific mode in which the
figures are presented, that it facilitates such explanations as are
pertinent of any of the ratios.</p>

<p>For instance, some of the ratios are undoubtedly affected by the
fact that the claims for the year of the company in question have
been exceptionally high or low, or that the company (being of
recent organization perhaps) has just incurred exceptional expense
to increase its business, the advantage of which will appear later,
etc. But I leave to the companies themselves to show to what extent
such circumstances have affected their ratios; except that, in
regard to the several net rates of interest earned, it is proper to
say that in all cases in which they considerably exceed the average
of 5.42 per cent. it will be found, by referring to the details of
interest receipts reported to the Commissioner, that the excess is
owing to the fact of exceptional profits by the sale of stocks, or
recovery on investments previously reckoned as loss.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
